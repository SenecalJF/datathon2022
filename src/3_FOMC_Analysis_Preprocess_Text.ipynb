      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that were initiated at previous meetings.  In particular, the Committee is keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue the program that we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities.  Our purchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates.  Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.    1 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run.  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the longer run.  Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to revision.   The central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices.  In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  Participants’ projections for real GDP for 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on  2 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL growth earlier in the year.  In particular, global supply chain disruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan have diminished.  Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.   The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors.  Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.   In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters.  Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.  The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   In short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  Most notably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which  3 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth.  European leaders have recently announced a number of steps to address those issues.  We will continue to monitor European developments closely.   I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.  Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers.  In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan.  However, inflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages.  Furthermore, survey measures and Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014.  The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.   The current economic outlook provides important context for understanding today’s policy decision.  The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.  With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming  4 of 22 \f",

Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy public communications.  Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance of monetary policy.  However, no decisions about such approaches were made at this meeting.   Thank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.   \n",

      "STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, it seems there’s been increasing criticism of the Fed’s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from the GOP leadership.  Several GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.  On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candidates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what’s good for the economy, and we’re not going to take any politics into account.    5 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk.  I would simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid.   \n",

Unemployment is far too high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectrum are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the financial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpretation of that was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers’ salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collapse of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take those steps.  If we hadn’t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.

I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to help create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn income, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.

I think it’s clear that—in retrospect, that the severity of the financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.

And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation.  And we’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in were very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.

One is that we can look at our own financial institutions and try to assess the exposures and the linkages between our institutions and those in Europe and the sovereign debt in Europe, and we’ve been doing that on a consistent basis.  We’ve looked also, of course, with other regulators at money  19 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL So that’s one thing that we can do.  And the other thing that we can do is stand ready, if necessary, to provide whatever support the broader economy needs and the financial system needs, should things worsen.  I mean, we are hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously implemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these stresses, but in the case that things do get worse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the U.S. economy from the effects.   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  It’s a little bit early to fully assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be having the intended effect of lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve, as was anticipated.  That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates which are relevant to the economy.  We are quite aware that very low interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have costs for a lot of people.  They have costs for savers.  We have complaints from banks that complain that their net interest a protracted period require them to make larger contributions.  So we are aware of those concerns, and we take them very seriously.   I think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and recovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy conditions accommodative, trying to support the recovery, trying to support job creation.

I mean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an economy which is growing.  And so, we believe that our policy will ultimately benefit not just workers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that they can earn on their investments will improve with the improvement in the economy.   \n",

      "\n",
      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—that is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy.  If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s been a very slow process here, there’s no reason to think that the same basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy.  21 of 22 \f",
      "November 2, 2011  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.  So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it’s still amenable to monetary policy.   \n",

But given that in the statement it says that the Committee saw growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say that the FOMC is less aggressively considering more policy accommodation, given the improvement they saw in the third quarter?   \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter.  So there was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in the period, in financial acknowledging in our statement, that’s true.  But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook relative to our June projections has been downgraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory over the next few years.  And we’ll continue to ask ourselves whether or not additional stimulus or additional actions can provide a better outcome, and that’s certainly something that remains on the table and we’ll continue to evaluate as we go forward.

The median projection is 5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024.  Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so.  At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point, resulting in a 1½ percentage point increase in the target range so far this year.  The Committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet—which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a ½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations.  We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably.  In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the  \f",
      "June 15, 2022    Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL target range was warranted at today’s meeting.  This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels.  And it will help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage points higher than projected in March and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer-run value.  The median projection rises further to 3.8 percent at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, still above the median longer-run value.  Of course, these projections do not represent a Committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common.  From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting.  We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid  \f",

We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability.  The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude:  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Thank you.  And I look forward to your questions.  \n",

When  the  dollar  came  intodemand  in late  February,  early March, the  Bundesbank supplemented  itsspot  sales  of  dollars  with  forward  sales  of  dollars  against marks  fordelivery in  early May.  The  choice  of  dates was  related  to  the\f",

Mark  liquidity was  expectedto  be more  ample  in  early May  than  in early March, so  the  forwardsales  of  the dollar  would help mop  up  some  of  that  excess  liquidity.The  total  was was  sharing  half  of  the mark proceeds  of  its  spot  sales  of  dollarswith us  at  the  time,  and we  had no  idea how  long  the  dollar wouldremain  in demand, we  asked them  if  they might  also  share  the proceedsof  the  forward sales.  It  took  them  several  days  to  come  back with ananswer;  and when they did,  they  set  some  conditions  that  requiredconsultations  on our  side within  the  Federal  Reserve  and with theTreasury.  In  the meantime  the dollar  continued  to  rise  and  the  Systemcontinued  to make  good progress  in  repaying  swap debt.  In view of  theTreasury's  need for marks  to  cover  the Carter  notes,  we  finallyagreed.  In  response,  the Bundesbank  raised no objection.  But  afterfurther  review on  their  part,  they insisted  that  the  Federal  Reserveas  the  central  bank  of  the United  States  be  the  direct  counterparty onthe  forward  contracts  rather  than  the  U.S. Treasury.Subject to  your  approval,  the  solution we have worked out  isthat  the  System would enter  into  two  sets  of  forward  contracts:  onewith the Bundesbank  to  obtain  the marks directly  from it,  so  that  asthe  central  bank of  the United  States  we are  sharing  in  thatoperation;  and  the  other between  the Federal  Reserve  and  the  Treasuryto  pass  the  marks directly on  to  the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund.These  transactions  would be  at  the  same  rates,  so  there  is  neitherprofit  nor  loss  to  the  System.

Since  some  of  the  Treasury's mark debt  is  ateven higher  mark rates  than  those  on  these contracts,  the  costcomparisons  are not excessively  unfavorable to  the  Treasury.Moreover,  should the  System need  to  incur  additional  swap  debt beforefrom us  so  that we  could use  the marks  in  repayment.

There was  a certain  amount  ofpressure  that emerged  almost  automatically out  of  the  process  just  byour  sticking to  our nonborrowed path when  the banks were  demandingadditional  reserves.  That automatically imposed  some  increased needfor  borrowing.  And then a further  downward adjustment  was made  in  thenonborrowed path  to  increase  the degree  of pressure,  and at  about  thesame  time  the  discount rate was  raised.  So by  forcing  the banks  toborrow--I  think it  was around  $1.8  billion--at  an even higher  discountrate, we  put  still  greater upward pressure  [on  rates].  What we  got,as  I described, was  a very substantial move  in  short-term rates  of  3or  4 percentage points  over  a few weeks.  And  I think  it  got somebanks  feeling  that  they were  staring very hard at  the  possibility of  acrunch and the  prospect  of  just  not being able  to  fund  themselves.  Soin  that  sense the  program is  working;  it  has  [produced]  very realrestraint  for the  banking system.

Well,  I share much of  what  Mr. Sternlight  says.If  you  want to  estimate an  interest  rate  that would produce  theseresults--I  was hoping this  method would get  away  from that a little--it  seems  to me  that,  if  anything,  it  would be more  like  the  federalfunds  rate.  In essence,  if  you look over  a long  enough time period,it  doesn't matter very much what  part  of  the  total  reserves  issupplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part  is  borrowed.  Whatreally matters  for determining  the money  supply  is  the  amount  ofreserves,  the  total  base out  there  to  support money in  some multipliersense.  And over  a  long  enough period, it  can't  really matter whetherthat's  through nonborrowed reserves  or borrowed reserves.  In  the veryshort  run because  of  this mix, with required reserves  fixed, it  doesmatter  because it  affects  the behavior  of  the  funds  rate given  thediscount  rate.  But  if  we put  in  a high  discount  rate, then  for  anygiven total  reserves we would have  less  borrowed reserves and morenonborrowed.  If  our  estimate  of  the discount rate  is  low, we'd havethe  reverse situation.  So, while we could do  that, we would simply bechanging  the  mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves  for  anygiven level  of  total  reserves  that would  support  the money supply.  Idon't  think  that  would be  very helpful  to  you;  we  would be glad to  doit,  of  course.

There  was very fine work on  that.  Yet  the  net  outcome wasthat  total  reserves got  out  of  hand on  the  up side  for a while.

I don't  think  it's very important  todo  it,  but we  could without  lagged reserve  accounting.  But we'd haveto  have very large movements  in  the  federal  funds  rate because  we'dhave  to  force  the  banks, within  the  statement week, to  adjust  theirdeposits to  the  total  reserves we'd put  out  there.  We'd have  to  forcethem to  do  it.  Without  lagged reserve  accounting  that  is  possible.With lagged reserve accounting, that  could also  occur.  If  we  allowenough pressure on  the  funds  rate,  they could make the  adjustments  indeposits but we just  won't  see  it  in  total reserves  until  two weekslater.  So within  a very short-run period it  would look as  if we weremissing  our  total  reserves;  but  actually we'd be getting  adjustmentsin  deposits  that would be  [evident]  in required reserves  two  weekslater and we'd really not be  off  very badly.  We would just  be overpath for  a while  and then we'd be back  on path.  That's  the  essence  ofwhat Mr. Sternlight  is  saying  and I wouldn't quarrel with  thatparticular statement.  Indeed,  the money supply  is  coming back ontarget  now, or  seemingly so,  if March turns  out  as  we  are projectingit.  There has  been a rapid  response  to  the rise  in  the  funds  ratethat  has occurred,  just  as  happened in  October, which may be  acoincidence or  it  may be  that  the  lags  [in  response  to changes  in]  thefunds  rate are not  six months  [but  are  closer to]  one  day.

And he's not  going  tohave any alternative but  to  chase  those  borrowings  down and  put  inmore  nonborrowed.  Because  of  the volatility  of  deposits week  to week,I  think we'd be  certain  to get more  fluctuations in  the  federal  fundsrate.  However, with  the  system we're now  operating on, where  he  knowsrequired reserves  and we make  adjustments  on  an  average path  for  afour-week period, we make  those adjustments  so  that we  [take  intoaccount]  the  required  reserve pattern  that we  know  for  certain  overthe  two weeks  ahead.

That's because we  could adjust  theborrowings, presumably, to  achieve the  same result.

I didn't  give you  the  specifics, but  it  assumesroughly  a $1 billion  increase  in M1  in  the week of  the  19th, which  isthe week we're  in, another  $2-1/2  billion  in  the  week of  the  26th,  andthen very  little  increase thereafter.  But  that  gives  us  a high Aprilfigure because  from February  to  the end of March M1  will haveincreased  12  percent,  roughly, and  that  gets  into  the  April  figure.  Iwouldn't  doubt, given our GNP projections,  that we're  going to  have  asecond-quarter rate  of  growth close  to what we've estimated here  onaverage,  something  like  4-3/4  percent.  Whether it's  going  to  comewith  a large  April  or  a large May  or  a large  June,  or whether  it  willbe  an even distribution among  those months,  I really can't  be verycertain.

      "MR. WILLES.  We have  recently done  a  survey  of  our countrybanks  and  they tell  us  they are  as  tight  as  a  drum,  and the  farmerstell  us  [the banks]  are  as  tight  as  a drum.  Yet  we  have very few ofthe  country  banks  trying  to pass  on those  loans  to  the  city banks,which  are not  tight  as  a drum.  When we  get  behind that,  [we  findthat]  they're passing them  off  like  crazy  to  the  PCAs  and  so  on,  butthey're  reluctant  to  pass  them off  to  their  city  correspondents  simplybecause  the  price  is  so  high.  So  it's  not  really a  question ofavailability  in the  normal  sense,  but a question  of  theirunwillingness  at  least  to  this point  to  try  to pass  those higher  rateson  to  their  farm  customers  who are used  to  substantially lower  rates.Now,  I don't  like  the  implication  of  that,  in  terms  of  the  directionwe  seem to be  going,  which  is  to  give  preference  to  small  businesses.But  I  think  that  is  the  real  issue in  their mind.  It's  not  that  themoney  is  not  there;  it's  just  that  they're  unwilling, so  far  at  least,to  contract  for  the  higher price.The  only  other  comment  I would make  is  that,  like manyothers,  I was  disappointed in  the movement  in  the  President's programfor  fiscal  1980.  That puts  a  little  extra  burden on  [monetary policy]for  this year.  Therefore,  to  the  extent  that we  do  err,  I think we'regoing  to  have  to  err  on  the  tighter  side  rather  than  the easier  side.For  fiscal  1981,  I  favor  the  reverse  of  that.  If  the  deficit  infiscal  1980  is  around  $35  to  $40  billion  and  then  in  fact  [the  budget]really  does  get balanced in  fiscal  1981,  that's  a  $35  to  $40  billion[swing]  in one year.  That  strikes me  as  a little  larger than we'venormally  accommodated and unnecessarily runs  the  risk of  aggravatingwhatever recession  we're in.  It's  too bad  [the  effects]  weren'tevened  out  a  little, with a  little more  in  '80  and  a little  less  in'81.

I have  a gut  feeling that  ifthe  forecast  is  wrong, the  result is  likely to  be a deeper  recession.I am thinking primarily in  terms  of  the  financial  strains  that  thesystem will  be  under.  I think we've  all  been  amazed at  thewillingness  of  consumers  and businessmen to  take  on  loans  at extremelyhigh  rates.  And it  seems  to  me  the  counterpart  of  this  is  that we maygo  into  a recession  [with]  an awful  lot  of  strains that  are  likely  tolead  to  a deeper recession.  One  sector in particular that  is  showinggreat  strains  even  in a forward moving  economy  is  the savings  banks;the  situation  in New England is  getting  critical.  I was  a littleshocked yesterday to  find out  that  they may be  in  a position to  haveordinary access  to  the  discount window within as  little  as  two weeks.If  that's  the  case, we have  an awful  lot  of  issues  to  resolve.  As  youknow,  in the  past we  have not  loaned to  organizations  that  wereclearly insolvent.

      "MR. MORRIS.  It's  true  of  banks,  too,  but  it's much more thecase with  the  savings  banks, particularly  in New England where theaverage yield on  their portfolios  is  very much  lower than  on the WestCoast.  That's because  (a) we've been a slow growing region;  and  (b)New Englanders  don't  change  their houses  as  frequently as  people  inCalifornia do.  That has  led to  a very  old and very low yieldingportfolio.  So,  not  only do  they have  liquidity problems but  they havevery serious  earnings  problems.  Most  of  the  savings banks  in NewEngland will probably show  a deficit  in  earnings  this year.  There areother  complications.  There  is  this  new dual  rate which was  set  up  todeal with  large  commercial banks.  I think that  is perfectly  fine,  inlight  of  the  fact  that  that's  where  the growth  of credit  has been mostpronounced.  But  some  of  the most seriously troubled savings banks  inNew England have assets  in  excess of  $500  million.  And  the  questionis:  Do  we want  to  charge  them the premium rate?  Another  problem isthat most of  the  savings banks  in New England are not  insured by theFDIC.  We  have  a state  fund which amounts  to  about  $250  million.  Whatdo  we do  when  that  fund  is  approaching its  limits?  We're  going  tohave  an awful  lot  of  issues  in this  whole area  of  lending  to  thriftinstitutions  coming down on  us  very soon  that will  need to  beaddressed.\f",

But  I must  say that  through Thursday  of  last week,businessmen,  and by  that  I mean mostly  industrialists, were  stilltelling us  in New York  that  they have  great  confidence  in  1980  being  apretty good year--maybe  not  a record year but  a pretty  good year.It's  true  that  the  money market  banks  and  the medium  size  and  largeregional banks  have  all  been approached  for,  and have  granted,  loancommitments.  And I know a few  of  them are  very uncomfortable aboutmeeting those  commitments.  In  upstate New York  some of  the  countrybanks  have been  expressing a great  deal  of  concern  about  the  effect  ofthe  current  level  of  interest  rates  on  local  small  businessmen.  Ithink  local  small businessmen  are not unlike  the  farmers  in  theMidwest.  There are  stories  that  automobile  dealers  are  just closingtheir businesses  because  they  can't  finance  their  inventories;  ratherthan go bankrupt,  they retire.  We have  the impression  thatinventories  are generally modest, although  for  some  small  retailersthey are  pretty minimal.  I have  the  impression  that  in New York Cityretail  sales  are pretty  good, but  that may not  be  the  case  outside  ofthe  city.  We've had  some  indications  that  in  the  first  two months  ofthe  year  there  have been price  increases, particularly by the  largegrocery  chains.  Some  people explain that  as  the  reason  for  all  thecoupons we're getting  in  our Sunday newspapers.  In effect,  it'sgiving  back the anticipatory price  increase.We also have  in  our area  the  same grave  concerns  that  Frankhas  in Massachusetts  and New England generally.  Our  thrifts  are  invery bad shape.  Three  of  the  ten  largest mutual  savings  banks  in NewYork were  in  the  red for  1979,  and probably more will  be  in  the  redfor  1980.  It  is  disintermediation on  the  one  side  and  terribleearnings  on the  other  side.  My  own  feeling  is  that  if  the  consumerhadn't  been running  out  of  gas  before  last Friday, he certainly hashad his  accelerator  taken away  from him  as  of  Friday.  On the  otherhand, though, we're hearing that  some  companies  are  accelerating thetiming  of  their  annual wage  increases.  For example,  if  an annualreview was  to  be  in July or  August,  they're  bringing it  forward.  Sothe  consumer may have  a  little  extra money  in  his pocket.  The  Boardstaff's projections  of  the  outlook  for the  next  15  months  seem prettyreasonable.  In  all  the  circumstances, my thought  is  that  we  shouldhang  in  there, which  is  probably what  \"B\" does.  That would be  my ideaof  hanging  in  there.\n",

      "3/18/80-24-Chairman,  the  Atlanta District  shows  a remarkable reversal  inattitudes  concerning  the economic  outlook,  it  seems  to me.  Just amonth  ago  our directors  and businessmen generally were  virtuallydiscounting  any recession, even  a mild  one this  year.  But  in amonth's  time  that  sentiment has  changed remarkably,  as  I say.  Theynow almost uniformly  see a recession developing  and perhaps  a deeperrecession  developing later this  year.  That  even comes  from our  SouthFlorida  directors  who had been reporting  very, very bullish  conditionsright  through  last  Friday.  These  sentiments,  of  course,  were voicedbefore  the  President's program and  the  Federal Reserve program.  It'sinteresting  to  note  that  this  change  is  attitudinal  and not based  onany real  change  in  basic economic  conditions.  Conditions  in  theDistrict generally are  about  the  same  as  they were, although, ofcourse, we  have had  some softness  in real  estate  sales  andconstruction  activity  and a slowing  in  retail  sales.  That has  beenreflected,  too,  in  a less  rapid run-up  in bank credit  than  in  otherparts  of  the  country.  But  the  perception of  the  future  is  that  we'rein  for  a very difficult  time.  Our business people  and directors seeautomobile dealers,  farmers,  small  business people,  and thrifts  beinghurt  pretty badly and  I think there  is  a real  fear  at  this point  of  acredit  crunch coming  along.  While  I don't  have any data, and my  staffhasn't given me any data  about  small  banks,  I have  an  intuitivefeeling that  some of  the  small  banks  in  the  District are probably  inmuch the  same condition  as  savings  and loans,  although perhaps  not  tothe  same degree.  My personal  feeling, after hearing  all  of  this  frompeople  around the  District,  is  that  the pessimism  is perhaps  a littleoverdone.  Recession, in my  judgment, would not be all  that bad if  weare  going  to  get prices under  control.In  terms  of policy,  it  seems  to me that we've  got  to  get  themonetary aggregates  under control.  February was perhaps  a one-monthaberration, but  there  was a run-up  in  the aggregates.  That,  togetherwith negative market  reaction to  the  President's  program, is  reallygoing  to  fuel  inflationary  expectations.  Indeed, as  has  been remarkedhere, with energy costs  increasing in  the  short  term we could have  anincrease  in  inflation.  That  is  bound to  cause consumers  to  lackconfidence  in what  has  been done  by the Administration,  and we  couldhave  an  increase  in  inflationary expectations with the  obviousresults.  So my judgment,  Mr. Chairman, which  is  a little  differentfrom the  staff's at  the Atlanta  Bank,  is  to  err on  the  side of  greaterrestraint.  While  alternative  B seems  to me a viable  alternative,whereas  I would not  consider  alternative A to  be  viable, my preferencewould be  to  go  for  something along the  lines of  alternative C todemonstrate  in  the near  term  to  the markets  that we're going  tocontinue with this  program of  restraint.\n",

If  we  were to  shade  it  a little,  we'dshade  it  along the  lines  that  Frank Morris  described because  of  theunrest we  see  in  financial markets,  along with weaker  housing and  alsoprobably weakness in  investment,  all  of which we think may be morethan  the  staff  is  estimating.  I would add one  other caveat  and thatis  the  feeling on  our  part  that  the  international  situation may beweaker  than  is  generally being assumed.  So  we would shade  theforecast  toward a little  deeper decline  than the  staff  has  indicated.By the  same  token,  we would expect  perhaps  a more rapid recovery.  The\f",

I think yousaid  it  all,  and very well, yesterday before  those bankers when youstressed that  the  backbone of  our policy still  remains  our efforts  tocontrol  the  aggregates.  Not  everyone  heard you yesterday;  there  maybe  some general  doubt that  we'll  do  that  and some  expectation thatwe'll  back away.  So,  one  could make a case  for  going with alternativeC.  But  it  seems  to me  that  alternative B is  strong  enough  tounderscore  our  determination.  The  rates  of  growth in  the  aggregatesfor  the  last part  of  that  six-month period are  substantially belowwhat  we actually had  in  the  first  three months,  or  think we had in  thefirst  three  months.  They are  below  our  targets,  so  \"B\" seems  to us  tobe  the best  of  the  alternatives.So  far  as  the  federal  funds  range  is  concerned,  I wouldprefer  to  drop the  top and also  the  bottom of  that  range.  I think weare  now to  the point where we  can do  that.  I would not want  to  raisethe  lower  end, a possible alternative  suggested in  the  Bluebook,  sinceI would like us  to  be  in a position to  let  rates  come down prettyfast,  if  they do  tend to  do  that  in the  face of  a controlled set  ofgrowth rates  in  the  aggregates.  I am  sure that  the  Committee  is  notgoing  to  agree  to  abandoning that  range;  against  that  background,11-1/2  to  18  percent  looks  about right  to  us.\n",

      "MR. WINN.  Mr.  Chairman, the  crosscurrents  are  so extremethat  it's  difficult to  sort  them out  and get a fix, particularly withlast  weekend's  adjustments  not being  factored into many people'sthinking.  Three or  four  things,  I think, are  interesting.  One  isthat  we  turned off  commercial  construction--that  is,  apartment  houses,office buildings,  and so  forth--completely in  October, and it  turnedback on  in  an unbelievable fashion  in  January and  early February.We've  turned  it  off  again, I think, really in  the  last  couple ofweeks;  there are  just  no deals being made.  But the profits picturethat  is  coming  through on  the deals  that  have been made are so  unrealthat  it's  almost unbelievable.  With the  acceleration  of  rents andwith  [builders']  fixed costs  not moving up, the  flows  back to  profitsare very, very high.  That's  particularly true  where  tax  reliefoccurred, in  California and Texas  and places  like  that.  In  spite  ofincreased operating expenses  the profits  picture  is  almostunbelievable.  So,  if  we get  any stability  in  [interest  rates],  myguess  is  that  those  [activities]  will  explode  on  us  again  as buildingpicks up.The  second thing  I'd  report  is  that  the major chemicalcompanies  are showing  profits  in  the  first months  of  the year,  andI've seen  figures  for month-to-month developments.  While  these areworldwide operations  and one  can't  sort  it  out  [for  individualcountries],  it was  interesting  to me  that  the price  increases  fromNow, I don't  know how the  price  increases  were divided up worldwide,but  these  are pretty  substantial price  changes.  They have  those[changes]  built  right  into  June--this was  before  last  Friday--so\f",
      "3/18/80-26-there's  a big move  in  some  of  these  factors.  And their  earnings  areunbelievable.While  building has  phased down and  the  automobile  industry  isstaying  a bit  soft,  [businesses]  in  our area  are  reportingunbelievable  orders  and profits  expectations.  Our  railroad people  arereporting really quite good operating  results,  much better than  theyhad projected.  And this  is  across  the  line,  [even]  with  the  downwardpush occurring  in  their  automobile business.  Our banks  are  showing amixed picture.  Many of  them are pretty well  loaned up  and are  notseeing too much demand because  of rates  in agriculture  and some  otherareas.  On the  other hand,  they are  not  seeing any problem withrespect  to  delinquencies  or  slow pays  or  any of  the normal  [signs]  onesees  on  that  score.  We had, of  course,  in  the last  couple of  weeksthis  tremendous  drive  to  increase commitments.  Their  customers  weretold that  lines  of  credit wouldn't be honored and they had to  convertthose  into  revolving notes.  So  there  was  a tremendous  scramble  tooffset  the  anticipated  [government credit]  control  system by  suchthings  as price  increases  and wage  increases  and  also  by an explosion,really,  in  lines  of  credit.  They were  taking  to  their boards  demandsfor  loans  that  were  5 to  6 times  their normally weekly increase.We really  don't  know what  the  outlook  is  because we don'tknow how people will  adjust;  it's  a crude guess  that we're making.  Inview of  your statement yesterday and other  concerns,  I am veryconcerned about  the  [potential]  April  bulge, which could be muchlarger  than  is  shown here.  And unless we  react  to  that,  our  owncredibility  is  going to  be  questioned even  though  [we  expect the bulgeto  unwind].  We  can't  say  \"Oh well,  it's  going  to go  down  in May andrespond  to  current  developments.  While  the  targets  of  \"B\" seem  to  meappropriate,  in  order to make  those  targets  I'd  like  to  raise  thatfunds  rate range  by 2 points,  let's  say,  to  13-1/2  to  20  percent,  togive  the  Desk  [the  flexibility  to respond],  if  necessary,  if we  getthis  kind of  bulge.  I don't want  to  raise  it  just  to  raise  it.  Butunless  we respond  to  the  increase, which could be  quite  large  in thisperiod, we're going to  have  a real  credibility problem.I am  impressed with those who watch  the Desk.  They will  tellyou  exactly what  the intervention points were;  they  don't  see  anychange in  terms  of  our  intervention points  which  [they  say areapparent]  to  the market.

While  their perceptions  are wrong,  they still  areperceptions;  and we're dealing with perceptions  as  people  interpretwhat we're  doing and how  they will  react.\n",

With the  obvious  exception  ofhousing and  autos,  things  seem  to  be moving along  at  a very  rapidrate.  There  is  continued strength  in  consumer spending;  it's  almosthard  to believe.  I believe much  of  that  still  reflects a  \"buy it  nowbefore  it  gets more  expensive\" approach.  Labor  demand  in  defense-related  industries and  high technology industries  such  as  electronicsand  aerospace  is  contributing  to  continued strength  in  employment  inthe  District.  Loan demand remains  strong at banks  and, despite  therecent  flooding  in California, agriculture  all  around  the West  seemsto  be  in pretty good shape.  I think the  difference  between West ofthe  Rockies  and what Mark was reporting  probably  stems  from  thepredominance  of  large branch systems  around the West.  I know that  inCalifornia  our  three  largest  banks are  among the  three largestagricultural  lenders  anywhere  in the  country.  And, of  course,  a goodpart  of  that  lending is  to  agri-business, but  they take  reasonablygood  care  of  the  smaller farmers  as  well--to the  extent  that we havesome  of  those  around the West,  and we do.  Demand for  lumber you'dthink would be  falling  out  of  bed because  of  housing, and yet  exportsto  the  Pacific  Basin area have made  up a good part  of  that.  So,  inshort, while  this may not be  applicable  to  the  national scene,  ourdirectors  just don't  see  any signs  of  recession in  our part  of  thecountry nor  do  they believe  one is  ahead  for the  regional  economy.With  regard to  the national  scene,  it's  obviously a different picture.\n",

      "MR. GUFFEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The agriculturalsector has  been reasonably well  covered  in  the  comments made by MarkWilles and Bob Mayo.  Our banks  supplying  credit  to  the  agriculturalsector are very tight with respect  to  loan/deposit ratios.  Butcontrary to what  Mark suggested, we  have  found that  the  country banksare  facing up to  their problem and raising  their  interest rates  toagricultural  borrowers.  They have no  outlet for  the loans  even  atthese higher rates,  however, because  the  correspondent banks are notprepared to pick  them up,  even  at  a discount,  at  the rates  the  creditis  being extended.  [Cattlemen]  are  withdrawing from  filling  thefeedlots  again as  they  turn  their present  stock, which implies  lessmeat  in  the  future  I suppose.  Secondly, as  we  go  into  the plantingseason, a period  of high  agricultural  [loan]  demand, there  is  a bit ofa safety valve,  if  you will.  There  is  still  a lot  of  grain  in  thehands  of  the  producers, which can  be  sold at  the  lower prices  nowprevailing.  That  would suggest  that  there will  be  a considerable\f",

The grain embargo  probably will  have  as  great  an  impactas  the restraint  program. there  are  tough times  ahead  in  the  agricultural  sector.What  I am  really  trying  to  say  is  thatTurning to  policy, Dave  Eastburn captured my concern verywell.  In  the  Bluebook we are  looking  at  a 4-month period instead  ofthe usual  2-month period or even  a quarter.  It  seems  to me  thatcredibility  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System may be  the  more  importantaspect,  at  least  of  near-term policy.  The potential  bulge  in April  ispart of  the  problem.  I'd hate  to  go back  to  the  [procedures used]prior to  October  6 and  focus  on  interest  rates.  But  I think  it'sextremely  important--for  international  and  domestic  reasons,inflationary anticipation, and  other  things--that we not  permit  [thefunds]  rate  to  come  down very  far  in  the next  month or  two.  As  aresult,  \"B\"  looks  very reasonable  to me.  I would be  inclined to  movea  little closer  to  \"C\" because  of  the potential  for  interest  ratemovements  if  indeed  the  demand for  money begins  to  ease  somewhatbecause  of  the  lower  projection  of  growth.  And as  I understand  it,the  restraint  program may depress  that  another half  percent  over  theyear.  How that  will  roll  into  the  [next]  two months,  I don't know.So,  \"B\" would be  reasonable and  I would be  inclined  to move a  littletoward  \"C\"  if  that were  the  sense  of  the  Committee.  I would also  setthe  federal  funds  range  by raising  the  lower end  and reestablishingthe  4 percent spread,  thus  coming  out with a 14  to  18  percent rangewith  the  anticipation  that  interest rates  would remain  in  the upperhalf  of  that  range for  at  least  the next  60  days.\n",

Well,  [Mr.  Guffey and  I] are  both  from Missouri,and my approach to  [policy]  will  underscore  the  great  diversity ofthinking that  occurs  in  the great  state  of Missouri,  Mr.  Chairman.Very briefly, the  general  condition of  the  economy as  we  see  it  is  afairly  level  one with  the  exception  of  the building and  real  estateareas  and automobile  sales  and manufacturing, which are  obviouslyquite weak.  Just  last  week we  had a group  of  savings  and  loan  peoplein  for  lunch,  and they  reported very severe  trouble,  as  your  savingsbank people  are  experiencing, Frank.

There  is  a much calmer  approach tothe problem  and a little more  Federal government credibility than[earlier]  in  the  farm community,  although they are  still  somewhatskeptical.  We  are,  of  course,  in a very poor position on  autos andhousing  throughout  our District.  But  capital  goods  are  still  runningquite strong.  This  is  typical  of  what  one  might  call  \"this  stage  ofthe  cycle.\"  I feel more  comfortable  than  I did last month with theGreenbook  [forecast],  yet  I would not be  surprised if  we  got  down to  aminus  5 percent  quarter  [for  GNP]  before  this  forthcoming  recession  isover.  I think we are getting  closer, much  closer,  to  the peaks  thatwe  keep visualizing  and postponing, and we  could easily have  a creditcrunch--though I don't  know how best  to  define  that--perhaps  in  thenext  4 to  6 weeks.Having  said  that,  I would be happy  enough with  \"B,\"  but  Iwould tilt  also  a little toward  \"C,\"  agreeing with what Dave  had  tosay.  On the  federal  funds  range,  though,  I would just  leave  the[lower  limit  of]  11-1/2  percent.  It  has no  real  significance now andI wouldn't want  to  see  us  push  that up  at  this point.  It  restrictsour  image  of  flexibility when  it  gets published.  Instead, I wouldjust  go  to  the 20  percent  on  the  up side  and be  done with it,recognizing that  that would give  us  cover  for an  interim period,rather  than have  to  go  back frequently  to  jiggle  it  up another half  orone  percentage point.  I don't  see any  objection  to going  to  the  20percent,  given the rate  structure we have  today.\n",

It  seems  to  me  that  the  new anti-inflationary programwill have  the  effect of  making  the  coming recession deeper than  itmight have been and might even bring  it  on sooner.  If  I have  anyskepticism  at  all  [about  the Greenbook  forecast],  it's  in  the  area  ofthe  timing  of  the  recession.  The  economy appears  to be  continuingstrong, or  relatively so.  If  I read the  Redbook correctly, most  ofthe businessmen around  the  country report remarkable equanimity  in  theface  of  the  economic  situation;  they just  don't  seem to be  excessivelyconcerned  about--or,  in any case,  feel  confident  that  they can dealwith--whatever is  down  the  road.  It's  pretty difficult  to  findevidence  of weakness  in the  economy aside  from housing  and autos;  onehas  to  look pretty  hard.  One has  to  look behind the  industrialproduction figures  to  see  that  there would have been a decline  inindustrial production had production of  autos  and parts  not  risen.Also one  has  to  note that  capacity utilization  in the  primaryprocessing  industries  and materials-producing  industries  has  declined.And, of  course, the  average workweek has  declined  somewhat.  These  areabout  the  only  signs  I see  of  any emerging weakness.So,  I feel  that our posture  at  the present  time  is  aboutright, with  the appropriate  tautness  in  financial  markets.  I don'tthink alternatives  B and C leave  us much  to choose  between.  Actually,[for M1]  the  difference between  them amounts  to  about  $900  million  atthe  end of June,  and  that doesn't  strike me  as  being very much moneyout  of  the  total money supply.

On  the  other  hand,  if  we  choose alternative C,we will  have  a lower rate  of  increase in  the  second quarter  and ahigher rate  of  increase  in  the third  and fourth  quarters.  Given thecurrent  situation,  it would seem  to  me better on balance  to  leanharder  in the  second quarter and  increase  the  restraint  then;  thatwill  [show  through]  in  the  third quarter  and allow for  a slightlyhigher rate  of  increase  in  those quarters  when we expect  the  recessionto  hit.  Alternative C would probably be more consistent with  thatscenario  than alternative  B, but  I have  to repeat  that  really itdoesn't make  a great  deal  of  difference.  On  the  funds  rate,  for  now Iwould  favor  a ceiling  of  about  18  percent,  but  I am prepared to  raisethe  ceiling  if  market  conditions  [warrant].\n",

These high  interest  rates  may hit  some  borrowersvery hard but  they don't  seem to  hit  others at  all,  and the net  effectone  can't  predict.  I see  that  Charlie  Schultz,  after  the  President'sprogram was  announced, predicted  a 2-1/2  percent rise  in GNP  for  1981,so he  doesn't  seem to  think  that  this  has  a very powerful impact.  Iam particularly concerned about  the  inflation  forecast.  I view theforecasts  of  both our  staff and  the  Administration as  wildlyoptimistic.  The  very slight  recession  that we are anticipating  isvery unlikely to make  that  kind of  dent  in  the  inflation  rate.  Ofcourse, we have  a history of  always  underestimating the  rate ofinflation.I am aware  of  the  repercussions  of  a firm policy at  savingsbanks,  small  commercial banks,  and  elsewhere.  As  these  [problems]come  toward us,  we have  to be  prepared to meet  them,  and I think weshould meet  them  in a liberal way--stretch  our powers  as  far as  theycan reasonably be  stretched.  But we  should not be obsessed by  theconcern  that  the  recession may last  a little  longer  or  even be  alittle  deeper.  As  I look back over  our  record, I am  impressed that  wenever  stopped  fighting recession.  We moved  imperceptibly  fromfighting  the  last  recession and  its  consequences  into worrying aboutthe next  recession.  And that  recession  concern essentially hasdominated  our  thinking and has  brought  us  now to  15  percent inflation.It's  a situation with very poor options,  but  I lean  toward the  firmerones.  That  is,  I lean  toward  \"C.\"  The market  has not been impressedby our  policy package  except abroad.  The bond market hasn't respondedvery much.  Short-term rates  are  actually down.  I think there  is  areal  danger that  if we now give  the  impression  that we  are  about  torelax  our  general  credit restraint  behind a shield of  selective  creditcontrols,  we will  get  the worst of  both worlds.  We'll get  theselective  controls  not working--I  have  not been very enthusiasticabout  them anyway--but we  should do  what  we  can not  to disavow  themcompletely.  That  is  best  done by not  throwing any burden on  them andby holding  to  a firm general  control.  I think  it's  important  at  thistime not  to  convey  the  impression  that  the  regular discount  rate,which wasn't  changed, is  the  discount rate  and that  essentially wehave taken  evasive  action in trying  to  avoid raising  the  discountrate.  We  should  so  operate on nonborrowed reserves  that  there  is  a\f",
      "3/18/80-32-good amount  of  borrowing  at  the  surcharge  so  that  the  rate  acquiressome  credibility.Finally,  I share  the  concern about  the  April  bulge.  If wehave  taken  15  percent  out  through the  seasonal  adjustment,  there mustbe a  lot  of money out  there--in reality, people  don't  draw checks  onseasonally adjusted  checking accounts--and  that  may have  its  effect.So  in  addition to  \"C\" generally, I would like  to  see  a  funds  range  of14  to  20  percent.

      "MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that  our  postureof  restraint had begun  to  bite before  this  past  weekend.  [If  it was]biting before this  past weekend, presumably  it  will  bite a  little morenow.  I have  to  admit  I've held  such views  on  several  earlieroccasions,  so  I don't  know how much weight  to put  on my current  view.We did hear  reports  last week, however,  of  several  real  estatedevelopers  being  cut  off by  large banks  in our District.  Our  recentsurvey of  the  agricultural  credit  situation  does not  reveal  thetightness  that  has been  reported elsewhere  in  the  country.  And I dohave  the  impression  that  our  farmers  are  among  those who  are  carryingexcessive  inventories  at  the present  time,  largely  in  the  interest  ofdeferring  income  tax  liabilities.I don't  know  to what  extent  the Greenbook projections  assumethat  the capacity of  people  to adjust  to an  inflationary environmentis  behind us  or  to  what  extent  it  might  still  be ahead us.  In  my areaI see  indications  of  a  good deal  of  capacity  to  adjust  further.  Someof  this,  of  course,  flows  from the  firm linkage  that  seems  to havedeveloped between  that  area  and  foreign  sources  of  funds  forinvestment.  Just  to  indicate  the  extreme to  which this  seems  to begoing:  I am told that  at  the present  time builders  in  our majorcenters who  complete  expensive houses  which  they don't  sell  promptlyto  local  purchasers  sell  them to  foreign buyers  who  then  furnish themand  rent  them  out.  And  this  is  a means  of  investing  funds  atobviously very low rates  of  return  currently for  the purpose ofgetting  into real  estate,  in  this  instance  in  fairly modest-sizepackages.  There  are a  lot  of  small  business  firms  being sold toforeigners  as well,  all  the  way from  the  family-size  motel  to  thefamily-size manufacturing  firm.  That  seems  to be going  on yet  at  arapid pace.  I note  that  the oil  drillers  have been  in Washingtonrecently;  they have  about  as much reason for  being here at  the  presenttime  as  the  farmers  had  a year  ago  and two years  ago.  The  number  ofactive rigs  is  at  a 23-year  high;  the  increase  during  the past  monthwas  almost  spectacular  and  the  increase  over  the  past year was  alsovery  strong.So,  the  signals  are mixed.  As  I say, it  seems  that  credit  isbiting but  activity  is  still  very strong  and  the  outlook is  strong.  Ithink there's  also  a good deal  of  capacity yet  on the  part  ofindividuals  to adjust  the management  of  their  financial  situation  tocontinued expectations  of  inflation.  Possibly  one  indication  of  thisis  the alacrity with which they  are willing  to  give  up accumulatedinterest  on CDs  for  the  purpose  of  turning  them in  and getting  a newone which will  carry a higher yield.  This  has  resulted  in  actuallines  of  people  at  banks  in  some recent  weeks  when  the new rateannounced was  significantly higher  than  the  rates  on outstanding CDs.\f",

Mr. Chairman,  I am in  favor  of  alternative  \"B.\"Even  [with  \"B\"]  the  rate of  growth  [for M-1A]  in  the period  from Aprilto  June would be  dropping  to  almost  half  of what  it  was  in  the  firsttwo months  of  the year;  even compared with  the  first  three  months,it's  very low.

      "MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I don't  know what's  going to  happen to  theeconomy.  Perhaps  I am associating with people who  are  in difficultsituations  and have  become very pessimistic, and it  may be  affectingme.  So,  I may be more pessimistic  than  I ought  to  be.  I would pointout  that  the projection seems  to me very, very  sensitive  to  the  savingrate.  The projection shows  no  increase  in the  saving rate  in  thesecond quarter and, therefore,  the  second quarter  continues  to be  nota bad quarter.  If  in  fact  the  saving rate  should  increase  in thesecond quarter,  it  would be  a bad quarter  for  the  economy.  And thatcould happen.  On the  other hand,  the projection has  sizable increasesin  the  saving rate  in  the  third  and  fourth quarters, and  those  are  thequarters  of major  recessionary movement.  Whether  those  increasesoccur  or don't  occur will  affect  the  character  of  that pattern.  So,we  still  have  the  uncertainty that  has been with us  for  some time,  andthat  is:  What  is  motivating people  and how might  [their behavior]  bechanging?I do  feel  that  everything that  has happened in  the  last monthhas  increased liquidity preference.  The  rise  in  rates,  which was verysharp  and very noticeable, and  the  cutting off  of  credit  cards  tocertain low  income groups,  even before  the  President's program, havebeen played up in  a major way in  the  local press  here  in Washington.The  feeling that  one might need to  rely on  one's  resources  more and onother people's  resources  less  in  the period ahead  leads  to  an increasein  liquidity preference, which would tend to  give  us  rather largermoney numbers,  generally speaking,  relative to  GNP than was the  casebefore.  I also  think that  the  relationship between M1,  or narrow cashbalances,  and the  real economy  is  changing adversely.  That  is,  ittakes  more and more M1  in order  to  get  a particular real  income;  or weget  less  and  less  real outcome  for  the  same M1  we  had before becauseof  [higher]  cash balances,  to  the  extent  that people  are buying morewith cash and not  using  gasoline credit  cards  and so  forth.  Thecredit  lines  that  have  been extended, many of  which may call  forcompensating balances,  and the  fact  that we  are  forecasting more  andmore  inflation, mean either  that  a given M1  is  going to  carry with ita higher  interest rate  or  lower  real  activity,  or  both.  And I thinkboth is probably the  case.\f",
      "3/18/80-34-So  it  seems  to me  that  it's  just  the wrong time  to bedeparting from the  notion of  a rather  normative,  reasonable increasein  the  monetary aggregates.  I would very much resist moving to  alower  aggregate path like  alternative  C.  If  we  get  the  recession,Emmett, which I believe we  will,  I think we'll  find  that  the  demandfor money in  the  second half  of  the year will  be  low  enough so  thatour problem won't  be  so  much the upper  end of  our  range but keepinggrowth within  the  lower end of  our range.That  brings me  to  one more point, which  is  that  I would hateto  have somebody ask me what  I was  doing  during  the  crash  and have  toremark that  I was defending our  credibility.  The people  who say let'skeep those  interest  rates  up  there,  regardless  of  what  happens, arereally walking  into  a major  trap for  the  economy and  for  the FederalReserve.  I very much want  to  disassociate myself from  that.  I wouldgo with alternative  B.  I would adjust  that  path  and slice  a littleoff  April  and put  it  into May.  I think that  has  the  same  effect,  ifthere  is  a bulge  in April,  as  going with alternative  C.  I amsympathetic  to  the  idea  that we need more  room  in  the  funds  rate rangebecause  there  is  a very good  chance of  a big bulge, and the Managerought  to  be  able  to move  if  there  is  a bulge.  If  there  is  no bulge,  Iwouldn't expect  him to  move.  Therefore,  I rather  like  the  idea of  a14  to  20  percent range  on the  funds  rate  which, with the  rate now atabout  16-1/2  to  17  percent, means we  have some  room on both the upside  and the  down side.\n",

      "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me make a  few  observations  thatoccurred  to  me  in  listening  to  all  this.  First  of  all,  it's  clearthat  the  economy is  fairly  level,  so  any month we  look at  thesefigures we're  going  to  find  some  things  down and some  things up.  Whatthat means  for  the  future  isn't very  clear.  There's  considerablestrength  and resiliency  over  broad areas  of  the  economy or  it  wouldn'tbe  holding level  or a bit  on  the  up  side  in  the  face  of  a decline  inhousing  and  a decline  in  autos  and  some  other  industries.  What  standsout  to me  is  that  we haven't  any room  to  grow here,  given the  declinesin productivity and other  pressures  on  the  economy.  And if  we  triedto  stimulate growth very much, we  really  would have no  chance  ofdealing with the  inflationary psychology;  we'd  in  fact  face  a blow-offon  the  inflation  side if  we  don't  already have  a blow-off.Secondly,  in my  opinion--and everybody can be his  ownpsychologist--at  this  point we don't  have many believers  in  the viewthat  inflation  is  about  to  ease off  or,  indeed, that  the  economy  isabout  to  fall  out  of  bed.  There  is  more  nervousness  than there usedto  be and  some  people  are  beginning to  question whether  they  shouldn'tchange  their views.  It  was  characterized for me  in  talking  to  somefarmers  from Iowa  the  other  day,  and  I think  their attitudes  areprobably  similar  to  [those  held by people  in]  other  sectors  of  theeconomy.  A couple  of  them  sitting near me  said that  they had boughtsome  land  last year  at prices  they  considered exorbitant  but  theybought  it  confidently with  the  thought  that  prices  would be  even moreexorbitant  this  year.  And  they are  wondering whether  they made  a goodbuy.  In  fact,  they're  beginning  to  wonder whether  they could  sell  itor  should sell  it,  but  they haven't  seen  any  evidence  of  a decline  inland prices  up until  now.  They were getting worried but  they hadn'tseen  anything.  I suspect  that  a  lot  of  industrialists  are  thinkingthe  same  thing  in  their own  way.  The  fiscal  policy program--and Ithink it  has  been underestimated  a bit  in  the  public press  for  avariety of  reasons,  political  and  otherwise--I certainly don't  thinkwas  strong  enough  to  change  these  attitudes  in  any  significant way.It  may be  to  the  contrary  in  the  feeling  that  if  anything  is  going tobe  done,  it's going  to be  done  through the  credit  policy side.So far  as  the  outlook  is  concerned,  it  seems murky to  me.  Ihear  all  these  fears  of  recession  and I even  share  them.  But  if  youask me  analytically whether  they  are any more  certain now than  theywere a year ago when we began hearing  the  same  things,  I don't  know.I am pretty well  convinced that  it's  going  to  start  some  time  and  that\f",
      "3/18/80-36-there's  a risk, when it  starts,  that  it may be  greater  than anybody  isprojecting.  But  I thought  that  a year ago,  too.  Just  when  it  willreally start,  who knows?  I know we--all  of  us,  I think--havemisjudged  the  timing again and  again.  I share  the  thoughts  that  somepeople have  expressed, most  recently Governor Schultz,  that we  betterget  this  over with  in  terms  of  minimizing  the total  pain over  a periodof time.  I am worried about  those  financial  institutions,  and theworst  thing that  can happen to  them  is  [for us  to]  fail  to do  the  joband get  the  interest  rate turn  fairly soon.  But the  way to get  theinterest rate  turned is  not by hastening  it  prematurely.  If  we  haveanother false  start,  we'll be  in  considerable  trouble even  though  thatclearly runs  the  risk  of  overkill.  That  risk  is  greater  in  itsinverse logic  than  if  it's not  killed at  all;  we'll  be  faced with  thesame  dilemma  later  on.In  that  connection,  in  getting  out  of  our  dilemma  as  best wecan,  I put  considerable emphasis  on one  aspect  of  the  voluntaryprogram, which is  to get  banks  to  begin saying  \"no\"  on  some  loans  andnot  to  put  all  the  pressure  on  raising  the  prime rate.  If  the  loandemands  come  home to  roost  [and  they  take  the  latter  approach],  itwill  exert  pressures  throughout  the money market as  they go  out  andtry to  finance  the  loan  increase.  If  we  accomplish nothing else  inthe next  few weeks--and I think the  time  is  very  short--if we  can getthat message  to  the  banks and  they can get  the message  to  theircustomers,  we have  some  chance  of  at  least moderating  the  short-runinterest rate pressures.  I don't  think we  have  a chance ofdissipating  them but we  do of  moderating  them and  getting some  elementof  rationing  in  the  area  of  the  market where it  does  not now exist,namely among  the bigger  business borrowers.  I would urge you to movepromptly on  that  voluntary program  and get  the questionnaires  out  andto  begin on  occasion, or  maybe more  than  on  occasion, a consultativeprocess  with  the banks, particularly  the biggest  banks  in your  areavery promptly.We have  the April problem  that  has been  referred to,  and allof  these  things  incline me toward resolving  doubts in  the  direction ofgreater  tightness  in  the very  short  run rather  than  the  opposite.  Theworst  thing we  could do  is  to  indicate  some backing  off at  this  pointwhen we have  an  announced anti-inflation program.  We have politicalsupport  and understanding  for what  we have been doing.  People  don'texpect  it  to  be  too  easy.  There is  an understanding  that a lot  ofburden has  been placed  on credit policy,  and there's  a willingness  tobe supportive  for  the moment  in  that  connection.  I would not give  allthat much weight  to  the  degree of  support we're going  to get  if  thisis  dragged out  indefinitely and we  have  to go  through  this processonce  again.Where  that  leaves me  in  terms  of  \"B\" and  \"C\"--I don't  thinkanybody mentioned  \"A\"--is that  at  this particular  juncture  I find  thefocus  a little  long,  frankly,  for me  to  come  to  any great  convictionbetween  \"B\" and  \"C.\"  I share  much of  Governor Rice's  feelings  aboutthose  alternatives.  I do  attach  some  significance  to  the  fact  that  ifwe  took  \"B\" literally, while  the numbers  as  presented on  page 6 of  theBluebook look  low,  [they  imply]  running  above our  annual  targets  inthe way we  calculate  those  targets.  If  we were  going to  be  at  themidpoint  of  the  annual  target,  it would require  a considerable  declinein  the  second half  of  the year  from the  5-1/4  percent  quarterly growth\f",

But  again, I  [wouldn't]  worry toomuch about where  this  comes  out  within  a range of  1/4  or  1/2  or  even3/4  percentage point  on a  February-to-June number,  since all  of  thosedifferences  are within our  normal range  of  error  anyway.  That doesn'texcite me  terribly at  this  point.  Other  people may have  differentshadings but whether we're  looking at  \"B\" or  \"C\" or  something  inbetween  in the  four-month  time perspective,  I believe  it  catches  thespirit  of  what  a number  of  people  are  saying anyway,  to  say that  inthe next month  or  so--certainly before we next meet--we  should beleaning  toward  taking  our  chances  on being certain  to be near  thosenumbers  in that  very short-run period.  I am not  saying we  canguarantee  that we will  be within those  ranges  at  any expense  ofinterest  rates  or  anything  else.  But when we're making up  the  pathsand deciding what  the  level  of  borrowing  should be  or whatever, weought  to  be  resolving doubts  and making  sure March is  as  low  asprojected and April  is  no  greater  than projected  or  that both of  themare  lower  than projected because  that's  where  our principalvulnerability lies--in  this  two-month period.  If  April  is  anywherenear as  strong as  the New York  figures  suggest, we'll  be  above  the  \"B\"alternative.  I feel  quite certain that  we  at  least  ought  to beleaning  in  the  other  direction, and  reasonably hard, during  these nextsix weeks  or  so.  We  don't want  to give  the market  a  false  signal  ifthe money supply  comes  in very  low for  a  couple of  weeks  that we  arerelaxing  too quickly during  this  immediate  time  frame, when we've justannounced  these new programs  and there  is  the  kind  of  feeling  in  thecountry  that  I think  exists.  There  is  plenty  of  time  before  June totake  account  of  any  shortfalls we  might have  in  the money  supply ifthat  happy event  should  occur  in the very immediate  future.  I don'tknow what  the March data  are going  to  show.

Oneinterpretation is  that we would deliberately  try to  ease  pressures  onthe money market.  [Market  participants]  are  looking  for  thesubstitute  in  this  voluntary program.

As you know, the budgetaryimpact  there  is  quite variable;  it  depends  on when the  governmentsells  those mortgages.  It's  an  interest  [subsidy]  that  ultimatelyshows  up  in  the  federal  expenditures.  On the  authorizations,  that's  adifficult  question because we  have built  in  a significant  increase  indefense  expenditures along the  lines  of  the  Administration'sproposals.  That  could well  go  higher.  A good deal  of  what  theAdministration is  proposing we  have assumed will  result  inauthorizations, but  not  expenditures,  particularly not  in  the  shortrun.  To  the  extent  that  the  defense  sector  is  geared up more  rapidly,there is  a bigger  increase  in actual  federal  outlays.  I think that'sconceivable, and  it  would obviously  feed into  the  real  side  forecast,particularly  in  1981.  So,  we've  assumed a good deal  of  lag betweenauthorizations and  expenditures.  I might  note that  defense  orderinghas  in  fact picked up  a good deal.  And in  the  fourth  quarter, one  ofthe  factors--not  the main  one--leading  to a significant  increase  infederal  outlays was a pickup  in  real  defense  expenditures.\n",

      "not matched:  MR, FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman, we  don't  have  any  esoterictales  either  to  report  from  the  Sixth  District.  We  would  generallyagree  with Jim  Kichline's  estimate.  I think the  Southeast  pretty muchmirrors what  is  going  on  in  the  rest  of  the  country.  The  economycontinues  to  expand,  although  there  are  a few  sectors  that  are  showingsome  signs  of  slowing.  Consumer  spending  remains  pretty  strong,although  the  drought  and  the  unseasonably  hot weather  affected  notonly  farm  prices  but  consumer  spending  as  well  because  there  were  notthe  usual  back-to-school  purchases.  Industrial  employment  iscontinuing  to  rise.  We're  looking  at  some  reversals,  particularly inthe  forest  industry.  [That  experienced  by]  Georgia  Pacific,  whichrecently  moved  to  Atlanta,  is  very much apparent  to  us  in  thatparticular  industry.  Higher  mortgage  rates  have  reduced  sales  of newhomes  from the  levels  that  were  attained  earlier  this  summer.  Itseems  to  me  that  13-1/2  to  14  percent  rates  are  about  the  choke  pointfor  most  people  for  new  homes  as  well  as  existing  homes.In  the  financial  sector we've  had  pretty  good  deposit  andloan  growth, although  it  has  been  weaker than  in  June.  It's  going tobe  interesting to  see  what  the  results  of  the  deregulation move  onGreenbook  there was  an  indication from  the  staff  that  there was  notgoing  to  be  as  much hype  in  advertising  for  these  new instruments  asthere  was  before.  We  don't  expect  it  to  be  very  extensive  in Atlantaor  in  the  Southeast,  but  we  do  think  that  it's  going  to  take  off  tosome  extent--that  there  is  going  to  be  more  advertising and  moreattempts  to  draw funds  through  these  instruments  into  the  banks  andthe  S&Ls.  Tourism  is  showing  some  signs  of  ebbing particularly  incentral  Florida,  and  in  the  Miami  area  the tourist  industry  is  adisaster.  They  are  doing very  badly  and  that's  true  not  only  in  MiamiBeach  and  Miami  but  in  Dade  County  generally.If we  had  some  concerns  to  express--where we would  differfrom the  staff  estimate--it would  be  on  the  up  side.  We  think thatperhaps  there has  been  some  underestimation  of  the  strength  of  theeconomy.  That  is  certainly  true  in  our  area;  we  get  people talkingabout this  quite  a lot  in  our  section  of  the  country.  After  all,throughout  this  third-quarter  period  we  did have  some  strikes,  such  asthe  AT&T strike,  which  I think  had  an  effect  on  the  economy.  We  hadthe  hurricane  in  some  parts  of  the  country.  I think we  have  to  takethat  into  account.  So,  we would  be  a  little  concerned  that the  third-quarter  number  is  perhaps  on  the  low  side  and  might  be  revised  upward.There  is  considerable  concern  in  our  District,  as  I'm  sure  there  is  inother  Districts,  about  the  [federal  budget]  deficit,  and  there's  agreat  deal  of  concern  in  the  export-related  industries  about thestrength  of  the  dollar.  Interestingly,  inflation  in  two  of  our  majorcities,  Atlanta  and  Miami,  is  running  about  1.3  to  1.4  percentagepoint  above  the  national  average,  so  that's  a concern.  Because ofalready  existing  inflation in  those  cities  and  the  threat  of increasedfood prices  as  a result  of  the  drought,  we  see  some  pressure  onprices.One  other  thing  I might  mention  is  related  to  industrialproduction and  capital  expansion.  Some  of  the  contacts  we've had  withindustrial  development  agencies  around  the  District  indicate  to  usthat  a lot  of  the  capital  expansion is  being  designed  to  improveexisting  productivity  rather  than  to  meet  additional  product  demand.And  finally,  Mr.  Chairman, there  is  a  good  deal  of  concern  in Atlanta\f",
      "10/4/83and  Miami  about  the  Eastern  [Airlines]  situation.  Governor  Martin'sremark  about  concessionary bargaining  certainly bears  on  this.  Thisis  a good  example  of  the  union  leaders  not being  supported  by  theirown  people.  I'm not  sure  they're  in  the old  man/old  lady  category  butthe flight  attendants,  for  example,  are  now coming  forward  andindicating  that  perhaps they  would  rather  have wage  concessions  thanhave Eastern  go  under.  In  other words,  they  are  tending  to believemanagement  rather  than  their  own union.\n",

      "\n",
      "not matched:  MR, FORRESTAL.  No,  the  flight  attendants are  unionized.  Andthey have  been mounting  a  petition in  both those  cities,  Atlanta  andMiami,  to  accept  some  form  of wage  concession.  They  are  saying  FrankBowman  ought  to  be  believed  that  the  losses  are  going to  be  extensive,and  it's  better  to  have  a  15  percent  pay cut  than  no  job.  Where  thepilots  and  the  others  in  that  company  are,  I'm not  sure.  Obviously,the  effect  of  anything happening  to  Eastern would  be  devastating inour  part  of  the  country because  Eastern  and Delta  account  for  about  90percent  of  all  traffic  out  of  Atlanta's  airport.

Mike,  the  pattern  of  inventories  is  prettycritical  for  the  forecast  and  I think you've  made  an  effective  casethat  we  are  not  going to  go  through what  is  considered  a drasticinventory  cycle.  But  the  thing that  strikes  me  is  that,  really,  thisis  almost  the  best  of  all  possible worlds  in  nonfarm inventories  wherethere  is  basically no  cycle.  And  I wonder  if  it's  more  likely  thatyou would have  a greater  reaction  in  terms  of  production than  whatyou've  shown,  in which  case  we might  have  somewhat  weaker  growth inthe  first half.\n",

We know that it could get us in very bad trouble in the long run; we just can't do that.  I'm delighted to hear comments around the table this morning, and certainly would like to add my voice, about the need to explain these facts in much more accessible ways and maybe to use more available and hitherto ignored channels to get out the story of what we're trying to do, why we're doing it, and how we're doing.  We need to do that in language that's accessible to the media and the general public and our political critics and our political friends.  So, I think the suggestions that Bob McTeer and others have made are right.  Perhaps we're being forced into it; we'd prefer not to be there; historically, we may not have had to do it but that's where we are today.  But to return where I started, I certainly think that your suggestion is as politically viable a way to project these targets as any other would be.  \n",

Again, a circumstance may arise where that may change. But should it change, since that clearly would involve actions that affect our balance sheet, it would require a discussion on our part to decide whether or not we wish to advise the Treasury otherwise or wish to act differently on our own behalf.

Marvin, on your quantitative policy at the zero-bound alternative, it’s interesting to me to think of it in the context of Japan’s experience.  Suppose the performance of the Japanese economy is similar to that projected in the Greenbook—a forecast of deflation in Japan in every quarter for the next two years.  As a result of all the problems that we’ve seen, people have begun to question what the real equilibrium interest rate is in Japan at the present time and what has happened to the trend of growth rate potential.  It seems to me that a quantitative policy may run into particular problems because the real rate of return on cash—on not lending it out—is positive in a deflationary period.  In contrast, there’s a lot of uncertainty, given all the travails they’ve run into, about what the rates of return are on other assets.  Could you relate this to Japan, please? \n",

      "MR. WILCOX.  It’s a truism that every business cycle is different, and no doubt that applies here as well.  There is another factor going on in the background at the same time.  While it may be that previously the recession itself was more concentrated in certain sectors, as you suggest, most of these earlier episodes were deeper as well.  All that is required for an industry to contribute to a reading below 50 is for it to have a decline in employment.  So if the absolute depth of a recession is greater, one would expect the dispersion magnitude to go lower even if the recession is more concentrated by industry. \n",

First of all, I just wanted to say that I thought the chart show presentation yesterday was very well done and extremely clear on all the underlying factors of the Greenbook forecast.  I was interested, though, in people’s assessment of where they thought the major risks were, particularly in terms of the fragility of the consumer.  There are aspects of  this more positive GDP report that in my mind call into question a little more how much strength is there or how much of the strength is borrowed from 2002. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  I talked to my contact at Wal-Mart on January 18.  He said that December sales at Wal-Mart came in substantially better than had been anticipated; sales at comparable stores were up 8.2 percent over the prior year.  And at that point in January, sales were running above plan, at better than 6 percent year over year.  He indicated that they had become cautiously optimistic.  Before they had believed that the turnaround was going to occur in the third quarter, and now they’re anticipating a noticeable turnaround in the second quarter.  He noted that their inventory situation is the best they’ve had in the last four years; it’s very low and exactly where desired.  They are totally cleaned out of seasonal merchandise.  But he went on to say that actually in some respects they ended up with too little inventory.  Ordinarily they rely on sales after Christmas, but they didn’t have a lot of merchandise to put on sale because the inventory had been pretty well cleared out.  He mentioned that Wal-Mart is ordering goods now, particularly from Asian suppliers, for next fall but is ordering very cautiously, expecting things to remain about the same.  They don’t see themselves in a position yet to order aggressively.  He also noted, though, that there’s something of an inconsistency in the nature of the demands that they see.  Discretionary items such as electronics—Cathy made a comment about that—sold very well during the holiday season, and yet consumers continued to go for goods at the entry level price across a wide range of products.  So in apparel or electronics or any of a broad range of goods, consumers are generally buying the lowest priced items in a particular line. My UPS contact spent quite a bit of time talking about the labor situation.  The  company’s contract with the Teamsters expires in July, and they’ve already started negotiations on a new contract.  That actually was reported in the newspapers just a day or two ago.  Both UPS and the Teamsters are well aware of the fact that the strike they had several years ago was very disruptive and harmful to the company’s business.  My contact said that they already are \f",
      "seeing some signs that their customers are making alternative arrangements for shipping.  And, of course, they are concerned about losing that business permanently if customers develop relationships with other shippers.  But he anticipates that they will be settling that labor contract early and will get it out of the way.  He also commented that they view the outlook as fairly flat, given that their customers are not showing a great deal of optimism.  Inventories are very lean; firms just don’t want to carry inventories.  So, he was not terribly upbeat.  On the other hand, my contact at FedEx said that although they haven’t seen much sign of a pickup as yet, they are expecting increased volumes.  The customers that FedEx talks with are anticipating increased shipping needs, particularly because of the need to rebuild inventories.  Lastly, my contact at J.B. Hunt, a trucking firm, noted that they don’t see business picking up as yet. Let me make a comment about the prospects going forward.  I want to start with an interpretation of what happened after September 11.  My interpretation is that a lot of business leaders were unnerved by those events and they went into something of a cash preservation mode.  They laid off a lot of people; they cut orders; they did not make any commitments that they didn’t feel they really needed to make.  But consumption demand remained surprisingly strong.  Though business people are still in a rather cautious mood, I think that, if we can get by for a few more months, some of that caution is going to begin to turn.  So, my instinct is that sometime this year we’re going to see some inventory restocking that will be big enough to skew the GDP numbers upward for a quarter or two.  But obviously a lot is going to depend on the maintenance of consumption demand in order for that to work through.  I don’t have any particular disagreements with the Greenbook forecast except possibly on the inventory side, which I talked about yesterday.  I think there is much more of an upside risk there than a downside risk.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our District economy in terms of the level of activity is still relatively weak.  But as others have said about their Districts, the signs are growing that the situation is likely to improve, and there is a great deal more optimism among manufacturers and businesses operating in the region.  Turning to manufacturing for a minute, the level of activity in that sector remains low.  Our Bank’s latest manufacturing survey found that production was down again in December after improving somewhat in November.  Employment, new orders, and capital spending were again low in December relative to a year ago. But importantly in my view, firms have become considerably more optimistic about the  future.  Many more of them are predicting a pickup in business and actually are seeing some early signs of improvement in orders.  So, looking forward, I think the situation is quite encouraging.  In terms of our manufacturing survey, the six-months-ahead index for production climbed fairly significantly.  Granted, the rise was from a low level, but the index almost doubled.  The new orders index more than doubled, and raw materials inventories as well as finished goods inventories increased rather significantly according to the survey.  So, there is a fairly strong positive attitude about the future among manufacturers.  Anecdotally speaking, I talked with several manufacturers who seemed very pleased with the inquiries they’re getting and the orders that are now being placed.  Moreover, they were saying almost uniformly that their inventory levels and those of their customers are such that they are hiring or intending to hire people again.  So there’s a great deal of positive news there, recognizing, though, that these are improvements from a low level. As for consumer spending in our region, the story is very similar to what you’ve heard from others.  Retailers throughout our District were very pleased on balance with the holiday \f",
      "season.  They talked some about the extensive discounting, and they expressed concerns about the pressure that has placed on their profits.  Still, they are very positive about the volume of  sales.  Auto sales, like elsewhere, were very strong.  There is some concern about used car sales and about financing related to earlier leases.  A fairly large distributor in the Denver region told us that each car coming back in on a lease has about a $5,000 write-down that someone has to absorb.  So they are a little worried about the impact that will have. The energy sector has slowed.  Obviously, with prices coming down, the level of activity has backed off considerably throughout the District, more so in the Oklahoma area than in the Wyoming area, though activity in Wyoming is still down.  Labor markets continue to be fairly easy in terms of the ability to hire workers.  It’s still rather easy to find new employees, and there are no real signs of wage pressures that anyone is talking to me about.  The farm economy is legislation-dependent, so we’ll have to see how that develops.  But overall, as I said, there are signs of improvement.  Looking at the national picture and comparing our outlook with that of the Board staff, we’re generally in line with the Greenbook forecast.  We see a little slower rebound as we get into 2002, but activity picks up later, and for the year as a whole our forecast is about the same as the Greenbook’s.  One thing I consider important is that, as others have pointed out, the balance of risks is shifting.  The risks are becoming more balanced, though I’m not saying that they are balanced at this point.  And I think it is a fact that we continue to have a very accommodative monetary policy, which should be a positive factor for growth as we get further into 2002 and beyond.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall business conditions in the Sixth District are now more mixed than I reported at the last meeting.  While clearly not as positive as some read the evidence at the national level, things are marginally less negative and at least are not inconsistent with the suggestion that activity may have bottomed out.  For example, our consumer sector continues to display resilience.  Most merchants noted that sales had met or exceeded their expectations.  But I must add that this was not the case for smaller specialty stores.  Discounting continues to be widespread, and the majority of the people we talked with said that their profit margins were noticeably worse during the fourth quarter than a year ago.  The most positive reports continued to come from discount retailers like the Wal-Marts of the world, whose profit margins were steady and whose sales growth was higher.  Automobile sales remained solid but predictably were down from their high levels in November as the incentive programs played out.  Real estate agents and homebuilders in our area noted an improvement in home sales in December from the November pace, and the volume of new permits issued remained strong, especially at the low end of the market.   Our important tourism industry and travel-related activity are still hurting, although we’re seeing some gradual improvement.  Markets such as Orlando are under considerable stress because of the low number of visitors and the abundance of hotel space.  The key factor in south and central Florida has been the decline in the number of European visitors.  Airport traffic through Miami International Airport was down 11 percent from year-ago levels, and advanced bookings at resorts for the first quarter of 2002 were 10 to 15 percent below last year’s level.  Reports suggest that several Orlando hotels are in serious financial trouble, with a number of borrowers having failed to make required debt-service payments.  Additionally, the corporate travel market remains soft.  Conventions are not being cancelled, but attendance is low.  Reports \f",
      "that car rental rates are beginning to increase and the fact that airline discounting is being scaled back may signal some improvement in business demand conditions.   Our manufacturing sector remains weak overall, and layoffs continue at a fast pace in the apparel industry, which accounts for one-third of the District’s job losses during this contraction.  At the same time, new orders have improved for some producers of industrial electronic equipment, and some firms have even noted that they were rehiring some staff and extending production hours.  Not surprisingly, producers of security equipment reported strong growth in demand since September 11, and both Lockheed Martin and Gulf Stream continued to benefit from federal government and foreign government programs and from the demand for private secure plane travel.   Large cost increases continue to be noted in health care in the form of higher wages for health care workers and higher health insurance costs to employers.  Bankers in our region, while slightly more optimistic than in December, still report that they are flush with liquidity.  Commercial loan demand is limited to nonexistent.  A contact at Equifax, a leading provider of credit rating services, indicated in recent conversations that the firm had several new and very attractive credit-related products but was unable to generate any interest in them from their customers.  The senior executive I talked with likened the hunkering down of business executives to a “deer in the headlights” phenomenon.   Commercial real estate markets have remained weak in the District.  State and local government projects, which as someone else noted had taken up some of the slack as commercial projects dried up, have now also slowed markedly as local governments face their own budget pressures.  The CEO of one very large commercial builder told me on Monday that he fears a significant gap in building activity before it gets restarted. \f",
      "On the national front, the recent flow of more-positive information, which many of us have noted in our public statements since the first of the year, suggests that we may now be at or near the bottom of the cycle.  The deterioration of the labor market seems to be easing, with average hourly wages and the workweek rising and jobless claims continuing to fall.  Even small businesses are noting that some jobs are becoming harder to fill.  Both of the consumer confidence surveys, which I take as coincident indicators, are now less weak.  Even manufacturing, as measured by industrial production and demand for core capital goods, is less weak.  Also, the signs of renewed demand for noncommunications equipment are encouraging.  While caution dictates that we not become over confident and declare victory prematurely, I find it interesting and reassuring that this is the first time in three or four months that the professional outside forecasts, our own internal models, and the Greenbook do not contain further downward revisions.  Furthermore, with the exception of Argentina, forecasts for the rest of the world have been revised upward. While the evidence suggesting that a recovery is under way has become more convincing, the strength of the recovery once we get past the initial boost from a significant inventory swing is less clear to me.  Like those who prepared the chart show for yesterday afternoon, my staff devoted considerable time in our briefing earlier this week to looking at how various sectors behaved in the quarters leading up to the recession.  That work underscores how differently a number of important factors varied from other recent cycles.  Those differences and the questions they raise about how the same sectors will behave coming out of this recession point out the uncertainty and the risks we face in trying to ascertain the shape and strength of the recovery.  I’m particularly struck by the remarkably strong consumer spending and housing numbers.  Like some others who have commented already this morning, I think one can make a \f",
      "good case—and the Greenbook has done that to some extent—that we are likely to get only modest additional contributions from those sectors in coming quarters.  I may be even more cautious in my outlook for those areas because I think there’s a reasonably high probability that job losses still to come will be greater than in the Greenbook baseline forecast.  And therefore, the return to job growth may look more like what we saw after the 1990-91 recession.  Businesses are under more pressure than ever to show profits and very likely will continue to    squeeze their labor costs. I have argued in the past that the outside reading of the implicit policy rule being followed by the Fed is to cut the funds rate until we see signs of a turnaround in economic activity.  The economy seems to be at that point.  While further fiscal stimulus now looks less likely and probably less needed, significant monetary stimulus remains in the pipeline.  Thinking more now about the longer-term path of policy, further easing at this point would appear to hamper our ability to return the funds rate to appropriate levels as we get into the recovery.

To me it seems to highlight the important point that inflation has gotten low enough that the particular inflation goal matters for near-term policy decisions.  In addition, the inflation goal has become important in the context of the discussion that we had yesterday regarding the zero bound on nominal short-term interest rates.  In my view these considerations call for some further Committee discussion at some point, perhaps at the June meeting, about the desired steady-state rate of inflation. \n",

[Laughter]  In that context I would just point out that I have great respect for the simulations, but there’s a huge confidence interval around those simulations when one is looking three or four years down the road.  Also with respect to the zero bound, if we’ve achieved price stability, we have high credibility, and we’re going to have to live with that threat of approaching the zero bound.  To me, one of the things that came out of Marvin’s presentation yesterday was that it made me optimistic that we can study the issue further and become more comfortable with ideas on how we can deal with it.  So before we make any decisions along those lines, I think we need to study it further and talk about it further. \n",

We have a study being done on the auction credit facility (ACF), which would be a discount window facility.  Rick Lang from the Philadelphia Fed is heading that up and is following up on the various issues Committee members raised when this subject was discussed about a year ago.  There are issues dealing with supervisory matters, risk management and asset management for the Federal Reserve System, and auction design.  Those are at least three of the main topics being studied.  That work actually has been given a little extra impetus by contingency planning follow-up from September 11.  An ACF-like facility could function in an emergency as a backup for open market operations.  As a consequence of Governor Ferguson’s and Vice Chairman McDonough’s work on contingency planning and backup facilities for the System, we have given that ACF study a little more urgency.  Rick and his group are to have something done on that by June.  If they can’t get a complete study done on all aspects of the ACF, they are at least going to have finished by June the work on the use of a discount auction facility as a contingency backup for open market operations.  But Rick is going to try to move along all the tracks so that we can have everything regarding the ACF ready for consideration at that time. A second project is the review of the SOMA studies that you looked at a year ago.  Each one has been reviewed by legal staff both here and at the New York Fed, I believe.  For the most part, they have also been through the economic editing process to get them ready for publication, and the authors themselves have reviewed that work.  I think it’s fair to say that the urgency behind this project has toned down a bit.

For the rest of the economy, we get annual information in the gross product originating data— which would allow us to look at that—only with a considerable lag.  Now, one thing we have noticed over the last six months or so is that productivity in areas where we have physical product data has been a little better than we initially estimated based on assumed labor productivity.  So there’s a little evidence.  We do not get those data with high frequency, and they don’t explain the fourth and first quarters.

But looking out beyond the Greenbook forecast interval—again, I caution you to take these figures with an enormous grain of salt and maybe an entire salt mine—we would expect close to another 100 basis points of tightening to be necessary in 2004.  Combined with the tightening we’re now assuming in 2003, that additional tightening in 2004 brings growth roughly in line with potential, stabilizes the unemployment rate at just a little above 5 percent, and holds the core PCE inflation rate at roughly 1½ percent.  So the design of this forecast was that it was possible for you to achieve that particular equilibrium going out beyond the Greenbook forecast period with the amount of tightening we built in here.  Obviously, there are associated strategic questions about tightening earlier versus later, and Vincent will be talking about some of those issues in his presentation. \n",

I’m  typically easily persuadable by simulations, but I think I like the scenario that you laid out— where we get started relatively early with smallish steps, feeling our way—better than the black and blue choice [laughter] that Vincent gave us.  The latter might be black and blue in some  different ways.  I would recall a point that Jerry Jordan made earlier, and that is that if we raise nominal rates slowly, if the real rate is rising, we’re still being pretty accommodative.  So that might be another argument for getting started on a rate increase relatively soon.  But the one point I would note about the simulations is that they lowered the cost of delay below what I would have thought, coming into the meeting.  And that’s an interesting point.  I’m not sure I’m ready to believe it, but it’s worth thinking about. \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Second District’s economy has been giving mixed signals since the last report, which is what we’ve been hearing from around the country.  There are scattered signs of increased price pressures, mainly in manufacturing inputs and shelter costs.  But overall, inflation remains relatively subdued.  Retail sales were on or close to plan in April, and prices were steady.  Consumer confidence was little changed in April, while labor market conditions were mixed but also generally steady.  Housing recent peaks.  Office markets in and around New York City have remained weak but have stabilized.  Business at Manhattan hotels has been improving and continued to improve in March even though room rates are down about 10 percent from a year ago—which means that they’re still expensive!  [Laughter]  Surveys of manufacturers and purchasing managers suggest continued improvement in the region’s manufacturing sector in April.  And bankers report stronger demand for nonresidential mortgages, tighter credit standards, and steady to lower delinquency rates. I’d just like to make a few comments on the national economy.  The level of gloom in New York business circles, which was profound at the beginning of the year and lessened slightly about a month ago, is now even greater than before.  The explanation for why business people are so gloomy even though profits are beginning to improve is that the profit improvement comes only from cost cutting not from revenue increases.  And they will not believe that they should move on business fixed investment until revenue increases improve as well.  On the inventory side, as I think all of us have been saying, the rundown of inventories actually did continue—though much more slowly—in the first quarter.  That continued liquidation now has inventory levels well below where it would seem businesses had wanted   53 of 81\f",
      "them, based on the trend line in business inventories going back to the mid-1990s through the first three quarters of last year.  Clearly, the inventory drop in the last two quarters leaves businesses in general with the choice of adjusting their view of the appropriate inventory-sales ratio to a lower level and deciding it is possible to run the business that way or of bringing it back up to the trend line.  If the latter is the choice, then of course we could get a bigger push from inventory rebuilding than I believe is in any of our forecasts.   The mood on Wall Street is very grim, indeed.  There is much comment about the investigations by the New York State Attorney General and the SEC of what may be a dichotomy between what analysts were thinking and what they were saying publicly.  Also, the cover article in Business Week is making them feel that this onslaught on Wall Street is  broadening to a popular cry.  One might argue that that’s their problem and they should resolve it, which of course is my view.  However, because of all this, there’s a skittish, nervous feel about financial markets, which I think has to be a concern to us.  And if the brokerage firms get into the bomb shelters sufficiently and are not making markets to the same degree that they have been, that would adversely affect liquidity.  Liquidity problems are bad enough in normal times, but if we were to have anything like a crisis from, say, some geo-political event—which is entirely possible given the situation in the Middle East—I’m concerned about whether we could have exaggerated market reactions simply because of the constraints on liquidity.

The best we can do is to say that we have a theory and these data are consistent with the theory.  In this case, quantity theory and a number of general equilibrium models say that an increase in the money supply will cause inflation, and we have this correlation in the data that is consistent with that theory.  Are you saying that we could have theories in which we predict that inflation will cause an increase in the money supply?  I guess we could invent some. \n",

      "MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This article that the Minneapolis Fed has published is obviously a very interesting one, and I think it is a timely reminder to all of us how difficult it is to forecast inflation.  After that research was done, our staff did some further work on the Minneapolis results, and the results of our research were reported in our Economic Perspectives publication in the first quarter of this year.  So I thought it would be helpful if I described our findings, which in some respects differ from what the Minneapolis study found. The first point relates to the use of the Phillips curve in policymaking.  The Minneapolis study, of course, talks about the magnitude of inflation—the impact of the Phillips curve in this type of analysis on the magnitude of inflation.  But if we change that and talk about the direction of inflation, actually the results differ quite significantly because the naïve model obviously assumes no change in inflation going forward, so it doesn’t help us at all in terms of predicting the direction for inflation.  But if we use the Phillips curve models, they do.  At least the analysis that we’ve done shows that if one goes out over either a twelve-month period or a twenty-four­month period, the Phillips curve model in seven out of the ten cases, 70 percent of the time, does accurately predict the direction of inflation going forward.  So from a policy standpoint, that’s not inconsequential; it’s of some benefit. Secondly, the period used in the Minneapolis study, 1984 to 2000, is a period when there was some structural change, as was pointed out in the Board staff’s study .  There really was a change in the way our central bank approached inflation.  We became much more anti-inflation in the 1980s and the 1990s than we were before, and that is likely to have influenced the behavior of inflation.  So to some extent then, the poor performance of these inflation-forecasting models that are estimated with data going back to the 1960s is not surprising.  If we look at the Phillips curve models in the 1984 to 1992 period, right after the change in monetary policy, they 12 of 179\f",
      "don’t do well.  But if we break the period differently and look at the interval from 1992 to 2000, they actually do well in forecasting inflation, much as they did in the period prior to 1984. The third and last point I’d mention is that this study looked only at forecasting over a twelve-month period.  When one looks out over a twenty-four-month period, the Phillips curve models do better than the naïve model.  So clearly, there are limitations to these Phillips curve types of models, but I wouldn’t discard them completely.  I think there is some benefit to policymaking from these types of approaches. \n",

Your point about why it is that we have benefited from this makes a lot of sense.  But then another point you make is that to some extent the question now is our resolve and how much further we can go.  There has been a huge amount of discussion about this so-called productivity surprise.  I would  think that at this stage workers are no longer as easily fooled about it.  Also, I believe that some of these changes are structural, particularly the Internet and perhaps developments in help  supply.  One change you didn’t put in your exhibit is the fact that variable pay had become important and may well become less important.  All these developments might leave this Committee relatively quickly—no more than the five years that Bill McDonough talked about— in a potentially more difficult situation of higher productivity growth but still more-rapid adjustment in wages.  I’d like to know if there are any early signs that you look at or if you have any thoughts about how much time we have here because in some sense we are living on borrowed time.   \n",

And, of course, your point that the productivity acceleration represents 63 percent of the difference between the two simulations makes it extremely important.  I was wondering if you’ve looked at this trend in compensation and productivity in relationship to labor’s share of the total income pie.  I remember these data very well.  As we all know, labor’s share came down from 1990 to 1997 and then started to go up in 1997 and is now near its historical highs.  The reason I remember these data so well is that in 1996, at the request of our Bank’s chairman, who at the time was the head of the Chicago AFL-CIO, we gave a presentation to our board of directors on compensation trends.  He saw the nonlabor share going up and, of course, got very concerned.  After he left our board, that share started to come down.  [Laughter]  I’ve always been meaning to bring him up to date on these data.  So, I was just wondering if you’ve thought about that in the context of the analyses that you’ve done in this paper. \n",

      "MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The pace of economic recovery in the West has been moderate since our last meeting, although employment growth has remained lackluster.  Consumer spending continues to be the primary driver of the recovery, fueling growth in retail trade, travel and tourism, and many service-producing industries.  Heavy discounting, however, remains a drag on profits.  The ongoing resiliency of household spending is most apparent in District housing markets.  Although the pace of home-price appreciation has moderated in recent months, home prices and home sales are increasing in a number of states, with conditions definitely favoring sellers.  Residential real estate markets are especially strong in California, where multiple bids and selling prices above asking prices are becoming commonplace.  The sustained strength in housing demand is spurring new building, especially in areas attractive to retirees like Southern California and Arizona.  The pickup in homebuilding is a welcome boost to the construction industry, which has seen a sharp drop-off in demand for commercial development.  Signs of improvement are emerging in the District IT sector, especially for high-tech manufacturers.  New orders and sales have increased since the fourth quarter, helping many factories draw down inventories and increase output.  Increased use of existing capacity has prompted some IT businesses to reinstate investment plans postponed in 2001.  This is having a positive effect on makers of measurement and controlling devices and other production equipment.  Semiconductor equipment manufacturers, for example, are seeing new orders surpass sales for the first time in more than a year.  The pickup in production also is boosting work hours and salaries of IT workers.  Contacts report greater use of overtime and fewer forced furloughs; and many companies are rescinding moratoriums on salary increases and incentive pay.  That said, the industry outlook remains uncertain, especially concerning IT employment.  70 of 179\f",
      "Last week, a number of District companies revised downward their earnings expectations, citing slowing demand and significant price pressure.  More fundamentally, a number of high-tech manufacturers are using the lull in activity to rethink their production strategies, sometimes moving fabrication and support functions offshore. The reality of budget shortfalls is beginning to affect state and local government spending.  Some scheduled public construction projects have been put on hold and hiring and salary freezes for government agencies are being put in place.  Most importantly, officials in many Twelfth District states are concerned that further budget cuts will be needed, given the slow pace of recovery. Turning to the national economy, recent economic news overall has been on the low side of what we had expected, and we’ve reduced our second-quarter forecast of real GDP growth to 2½ percent.  Looking at the next year and a half, we continue to see a moderate expansion as the most likely outcome, with the recent declines in equity prices and the dollar tending to offset each other’s effects on aggregate demand.  Assuming that the funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter and reaches 4 percent by the end of next year, we project real GDP growth of about 4¼ percent in 2003.  And we continue to expect inflation to remain well contained, with the core PCE price index averaging about 1½ percent both this year and next. While our basic view of the outlook hasn’t changed, recent financial developments highlight some risks.  Growing concerns about corporate accounting and governance appear to be adding to the already existing downward pressure on U.S. stock markets and may be raising borrowing costs for some firms.  In addition to the risks from the stock market for consumer spending, eroding confidence in U.S. corporations also may be undermining business investment by raising the cost of capital.  The chances of the expansion taking off this year would be greatly 71 of 179\f",
      "reduced if the incipient recovery in equipment and software spending were to stall.  These developments may be giving us more breathing room in deciding when to begin the process of raising the funds rate.   However, the policy implications could be the opposite if eroding confidence in U.S. corporations were to add to the already existing downward pressure on the dollar stemming from a persistent current account deficit.  As illustrated in an alternative simulation in the international part of the Greenbook, we could end up with little net effect on U.S. output together with faster price increases, which would suggest a tighter policy.  For now, however, it seems appropriate to wait a while longer before beginning to raise the funds rate. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District’s economy has continued to show signs of improvement over the past several weeks since our last meeting, although some  sectors obviously remain weak and businesses are still acting in a cautious manner.  Prospects for District manufacturers actually have improved further though, with new orders rising above year-ago levels for the first time since the end of 2000.  Retail sales excluding autos remain solid, with strong sales at both high-end stores and large discounters making up for somewhat slow sales in other stores.  Home sales have continued strong in most of the District, and energy activity has picked up rather noticeably in our region lately. Of course, not all signs are positive.  Layoff announcements were up in May and appear to be up in June.  Auto sales weakened somewhat, and commercial real estate remains in a slump in our area.  Also, while optimistic about future sales, District manufacturers appear reluctant to hire enough new workers to meet the anticipated increase in demand.  They are relying extensively on temporary help, preferring to wait for further evidence of recovery before they  engage in significant workforce expansion.  Finally, several large District firms in the telecom, agriculture, and energy trading businesses have experienced further deterioration in their financial condition and credit ratings since our last meeting. On the inflation front, wage and price pressures remain mostly subdued, although obviously we have seen higher steel prices and that has had some effect on a number of our metal manufacturing companies. Turning to the national outlook, obviously recent economic releases have been mixed.  Nevertheless, I do expect growth to be about 3½ percent this year and to rise to something over 4 percent next year.  The Board staff’s outlook is similar to my own: second-quarter growth at about 2 percent and second-half growth at about 3½ percent.  I think the forces behind the 81 of 179\f",
      "recovery are clear and have not changed all that much since our last meeting.  That is, productivity appears to remain basically sound, monetary policy—with the real fed funds rate near zero—is stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative, and the inventory adjustment is continuing.  These factors are working to strengthen the economy and offset the downside risks to the economy.  Still, the downside risks are significant, and I acknowledge them.  One is the accounting scandal, which monetary policy really can’t do much about; another is the geopolitical risk, which again we can’t do a lot about.  But those risks are real, and they are affecting psychology.  There is also a downside risk in capital spending, which has not picked up as much as we perhaps would like to see.  And that is still a risk in the future. Let me just say in acknowledging these risks that I still feel that policy remains extremely accommodative.  And I think we need to take a longer-term view of this.  Every measure that the staff has presented—every measure we have—suggests that the real federal funds rate is below the natural rate by a significant margin.  Let me clarify my policy position:  I have not in the past and I am not suggesting now that policy should be tight in any sense.  The conditions aren’t at all right for that.  I am suggesting only, and I think importantly, that we prepare to move to a less accommodative position.  I would say that for purposes of long-run price stability we are overly accommodative, and we should begin to consider a longer-term strategy to move ourselves toward—not to, but toward—a more neutral position.  And as others have indicated, we have an opportunity after this meeting through your upcoming congressional testimony, Mr. Chairman, to begin to inform the markets of this need and to develop a strategy so that we don’t catch them off guard as we necessarily move toward a more neutral policy. \n",

      "MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I want to make a comment about state and local finances, an issue that several people have mentioned.  I think that is going to be a concern for some time.  The census numbers for the State of Ohio indicate that during the decade of the 1990s—between the 1990 census and the 2000 census—there was a 12 percent absolute projections for the next decade are that we will have the second lowest population growth and employment growth on record, which means that the tax base is eroding.  A clear implication for the governor, the legislature, and many journalists is that Ohio needs to raise taxes significantly in order to address its problems.  So I hope everybody else also will raise taxes because this strategy is not going to work too well otherwise. Within the region, economic activity is generally characterized as slowly improving.  While the levels of sales and production are up from their recent lows, the pace of increase is certainly slow.  The recovery in trucking and shipping has been earlier and stronger than was expected at the beginning of this year; but employment, especially at the parts suppliers, has not yet started to rise.  Several of the manufacturers in the region believe that they will be able to exceed prior peak levels of production with significantly fewer workers.  I’m going to come back to that point in just a minute.  In the automotive sector, the combination of continued strong sales and optimism expressed by senior management is not translating into either capital spending or employment increases so far.  Instead, both parts and assembly plants are reporting that considerable overtime is being paid.  Reports from two specific companies are worth mentioning because they offer a hopeful indication of what would be nice to start hearing from others.  Timkin reports that its efforts over the last couple of years—the company has gotten rid of some plants, downsized, 83 of 179\f",
      "shrunk its labor force, and so on—will be reflected in much better earnings this year.  The firm  also says that both its domestic and its international business have been improving recently.  Pittsburgh Plate and Glass notes that demand from both the residential construction and the automotive sectors remains strong and now its chemical business is recovering after a two-year slump.  Moreover, the weaker dollar is helping exports, and overall profitability is now rising. The tourist destinations in the region are off to a strong start, and industry observers believe that traffic will easily exceed last year’s levels.  But group sales, mainly blocks of tickets sold to companies that use them for their employees, are down.  Hiring at these tourist locales has been much easier this year.  And contacts say that wages paid have remained flat for the third year in a row, but they are still able to raise ticket prices. One large retailer headquartered in the District, Federated, continues to struggle but seems to accept that their problem may well be simply that their business model doesn’t fit the current environment.  Another director who sits on the Kohl’s Department Stores board always provides a cheerful and optimistic report to offset the downbeat report that we get from Federated.  In retail categories, furniture, appliances, electronics, and jewelry are all reported to be strong.  In view of the low reported levels of inventories in these categories, retailers are reporting fewer sales promotions and markdowns than a year ago at this time.   The housing market at the lower end of the price range is reported to be doing very well throughout the region while the upper end of the housing market is characterized generally as being dead in the water.  Lots and lots of million dollar houses that were built don’t have owners or they have “upside down” owners.  The bankruptcy of a large residential builder in the greater Cincinnati area is creating a lot of problems because it involved a very major fraud.  We don’t know the magnitude of it yet, but it’s very large.  So there are a lot of single-family and 84 of 179\f",
      "multifamily housing projects throughout the region that are unfinished and abandoned.  This has  caused at least three dozen banks to incur significant losses and has left more than 200  homeowners with prior claims or construction loans against their houses.  We think there is one bank whose survival is very much in doubt and two others whose capital has been severely impaired. With respect to capital spending plans, even companies that are described as sitting on piles of cash—that’s the way their bankers describe them anyway—have taken a wait-and-see attitude.  And the reason given is that management is still unsure how much productivity and efficiency can be wrung out of prior investments before additional capacity can be justified.  That raises an intriguing question:  If at the micro level individual firms simply claim not to know their potential or their capacity, how can we be very confident about those measures at a macro level?  It also says something at the micro level of the firm:  There must be a shift under way in Okun’s law, and where it will end up we don’t know at this point. At a recent meeting of our Community Bank Advisory Council, several bankers described their business customers as sounding more pessimistic than their actions imply.  Nevertheless, it is generally asserted that business customers continue to pay down old loans and are attempting to build liquidity.  The almost total absence of reports of either business or  personal bankruptcies seemed to surprise even the bankers.  It appeared that there was a tendency for each member to believe that his own bank’s experience was the exception and that somebody else must be incurring a lot of losses.  But nobody claimed that that was happening at his or her bank. Let me turn to the national economy.  Whatever the problems of various sectors, regions, or industries in this country or whatever the problems plaguing many foreign economies, there 85 of 179\f",
      "certainly are limits as to how far highly expansionary monetary policy can go to be helpful before going too far and becoming part of the problem.  At some point, and I tend to think it will be sooner rather than later, it is going to become essential for us to move to a more neutral stance of monetary policy and to find the patience to wait for other necessary adjustments to work through the system. I want to say something about the idea of risk versus uncertainty in the classic sense.  Risks, of course, are at least potentially quantifiable in some probabilistic way.  The staff does a good job of sensitizing us to the various risks to the economic outlook, and that’s very helpful.  But uncertainties are quite different.  We face an environment where the uncertainties are more important than the various risks that we can identify.  There are uncertainties associated with almost certain events in the Middle East, but we cannot quantify those uncertainties in any useful  way.  There are uncertainties in the form of  “Enronitis” associated with the legacy of the last few years.  How much of that has carried into the present and how long it is going to hang over this economy and our markets is something that I don’t find very easy to contemplate in a quantifiable way.  The implication for me is that we are going to be event driven and we are going to be reactive for quite some time, and in my view that’s the best that we can hope to do.

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My view of the near-term indicators is that they do indeed, as others have already indicated, paint an economy that is stable—certainly not contracting—but not yet growing at trend.  For example, the initial claims data have come  down from their recent artificially elevated level, but they remain historically high—at around the 400,000 level that has prevailed since early 2001.  Certainly the most recent retail sales data were weaker than expected—flat in May—and are pointing to a possible slowing in the pace of increase in personal consumption expenditures.  And finally, the data for orders and shipments, as we’ve just seen this morning, are clearly stabilizing and perhaps turning up some but certainly are not returning to the pace of the late 1990s.   This picture is frustrating, I think, for those who had hoped for or bet on a sharp turnaround.  But this Committee should be mindful, as many have already said, that the gradual growth of the current quarter was anticipated in our earlier meetings.  Two of the three previous Greenbooks this year forecast growth in this quarter within a range of 2 to 2½ percent, and  growth at such a pace still seems to be the case.  While expected, however, this slow growth does leave one wondering what will be the impetus for an upturn or return to trend.  If the second half of 2002 is going to be stronger than the second quarter and lead to a stronger 2003, as forecast by both the staff and the consensus of external forecasters, we must soon start to see a pattern of more rapidly improving incoming data.  While that pattern of data is not yet in hand, both housing and autos are continuing to play the important stabilizing roles that they’ve played thus far for the cyclical episode. Additionally, as other have said, impetus will most assuredly come from monetary policy, which is accommodative; fiscal policy, which is likely to continue to provide a positive  impulse; and a weaker dollar, which will allow foreign demand to take up some of the slack not 105 of 179\f",
      "provided by domestic demand.  On the other hand, eroding equity prices, declining consumer and investor confidence due to a range of factors that Governor Gramlich has identified, and an uncertain profit outlook in the business community are admittedly creating and likely to continue to create some drag on both household and business expenditures. All of these forces taken together lead me to believe that the risks to the baseline forecast are, if you will, uncomfortably balanced.  Now, if contrary to most expectations the negative forces weighing on the economy grow stronger, become more persistent, and undermine recovery, then obviously we’ll have to react to that.  Similarly, on the other hand, if the turnaround proves stronger than forecast, we’ll need to move rates upward more quickly than currently built into the assumptions underlying the Greenbook or the perfect foresight outlook in the Bluebook.  Whether such moves will surprise the market is really uncertain.  Just as the expectations with respect to policy in a downward direction, presumably incoming data would get the markets to adjust their policy expectations up if indeed that were the appropriate response. Let me comment briefly on the issue that Vice Chairman McDonough discussed and perhaps take a slightly different tack.  I think the issue of preparing the markets is one that is rather challenging for this Committee.  We have the benefit of having the confidence of the possible, but we will try not to surprise them.  We don’t want to lose that unwritten but rather well understood pact between this Committee and the markets.  On the other hand, we don’t want a desire to prepare the markets to lead inadvertently to instability in the markets, which perhaps was what Vice Chairman McDonough was suggesting.  That does leave us in a bit of a 106 of 179\f",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s fairly evident that there is a secular increase in the value of homes relative to the value of other assets.  The consequence is that the extraction of funds from home equity values is a much more important source of consumption expenditures than earlier.  Previously, consumers were not able to extract cash easily out of the rising value of their homes, but they can now, and that source of funds has been a strong sustaining force for spending through the recession.  Unless immigration slows down as a consequence of September 11, it’s hard to imagine that anything really major is going to change in this regard.  And unless we get a significant decline in home prices, and that’s a very questionable prospect at this stage, it’s hard to imagine that there will not be very considerable ongoing support for consumption expenditures coming out of the housing equity markets.  A real concern lurking in the background, which we have great difficulty evaluating, is the potential implication of changes in the foreign exchange rate.  I know that everyone has a firm belief regarding exactly which way the dollar is going to go.  All I can tell you is that the history of exchange rate forecasts indicates a greater degree of confidence in forecasting such rates than there has been success. [Laughter]  Exchange rate traders will tell you that they make money only in marketmaking—in their bid-asked spreads.  I remember that month after month when I was on the J.P. Morgan board I would see a line in their report indicating foreign exchange capital gains.  And I kept asking myself how in the world they managed to do that.  I knew how difficult it was.  Finally, they all “fessed up.”  They admitted that they forecasted badly.  They hadn’t a clue.  But they were marketmakers, and their spreads were very effective in producing what was in essence service income for facilitating foreign exchange transactions.  In fact, the vast majority of commercial transactions involve a loss largely because of transaction costs.  Stock prices tend to trend higher over time because of inflation plus the capital gains that 122 of 179\f",
      "result from the accumulation of undistributed profits; but that trend does not exist for the exchange rate, which is trendless by definition. The general view that everybody knows exactly where the exchange rate is going, I think, is an illusion.  I don’t deny, as Ned Gramlich says, that the dollar is very severely out of sync with the international trade accounts.  But it’s the portfolio accounts that are crucial, and the issue here is whether we really know that the dollar is out of sync.  I don’t think so.  Are we going to forecast that it is going to depreciate?  Yes.  Why are we going to do that?  Because the current account deficit is very large and the recent trend has been a depreciation!  And I can tell you that you will get very strong agreement on that outlook.  If one goes back historically and reviews exchange rate forecasts, one will find that the forecasting of exchange rates is as close to a random process as forecasting any economic variable that I know.  So I’m not of the school here that is bemoaning what may happen to the dollar because I really know that I don’t know.  It’s very hard for me to hold that conviction, but I’m working on it!  [Laughter] I do think that the problems in Latin America, which Bill McDonough mentioned, are a sleeper here.  It’s not only Argentina and Brazil that are in serious shape; clearly Venezuela is as well.  Their difficulties all involve political problems.  They have nothing to do with economics.  I would add Colombia for the same reason.  These are big countries in South America.  Now the  question is whether there will be contagion.  I’m not sure.  In fact, I don’t know what contagion basically means in this particular situation.  Does political contagion spread?  It may, but I’m not sure in which direction.  For example, I don’t know what will happen if people see that Brazil is brought to its knees because of a populist campaign.  Fortunately, I gather—especially after listening to Bob McTeer—that Mexico seems to be doing well.  If that is indeed the case, that is good.  But Mexico is still a third world country.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was more worried about Vince myself.  Dino Kos, would you start us off, please?  MR. KOS.1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Good morning.  I’ll be referring to the charts that were circulated a short time ago.  On the first page, the top panel graphs U.S. and euro-area three-month interbank cash deposits rates as well as rates three months forward and nine months forward.  The U.S. rates are in red, and those for the euro area are in green.  The U.S. cash three-month deposit rates edged lower by a few basis points in the intermeeting period.  But the three-month forward rate fell about 30 basis points and now trades slightly below the current three-month cash rate.  The three-month rate nine months forward fell nearly 1 percentage point.  All of these rates were influenced by lower equity prices, economic data that came in weaker than the market had hoped, and budding expectations of lower official rates at some point.  The euro-area rates, shown by the green line, exhibit a similar if somewhat less pronounced pattern in recent months.  Forward rates for the euro area are now at or below cash rates.  The market’s fling in early May with a possible tightening of policy has evaporated, as market participants downgraded their forecasts of the economic situation in the euro area and as the euro’s appreciation came to be viewed as doing some of the ECB’s work for it.  In the bottom panel, Japanese short-term  rates continued to stay low, and there’s not very much to say there.  U.S. Treasury yields moved lower in the intermeeting period, responding to the same economic and equity market news that affected U.S. forward rates.  Liquidity in the U.S. Treasury  But one segment that has frayed a bit is the corporate sector, which is covered on investment-grade corporate debt for the year to date.  March and early spring were active, as many corporations termed out commercial paper into longer-term liabilities.  Issuance subsequently turned down and in the most recent weeks has slowed to a trickle.  Perhaps there are seasonal effects, though that is only part of the story.  As depicted by the red line, issuance held up during this period in 2001 with the exception of the July 4 week, which is always a week when there’s little or no activity.  On the demand side, investors who have taken losses in their portfolios in recent months have been reluctant to expand the amount of credit risk in their holdings.  And on the supply side, companies appear to be a bit more restrained about raising funds in the current atmosphere.  The middle panel depicts the spread over Treasuries of investment-grade debt since April 1.  This is a Lehman Brothers index, which indicated a spread that was hovering mostly between 175 and 200 basis points for much of the spring.  That was an already elevated spread, but perhaps understandable given the accounting and corporate governance issues that investors have had to factor into their pricing.  From  late June until early August, spreads widened another 50 basis points, to more than                                                  1 Materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).    4 of 92\f",
      "250 basis points.  Liquidity in the corporate sector decreased during this period, with dealers widening out spreads and reducing the amount for which a quote would be good down to about $5 million in many cases.  This has made it very difficult for investors to transfer larger positions.  While telecom names have been problematic for some time, new sectors have become tainted.  Energy trading and power companies are one example.  And in the past few weeks, the bonds of the auto companies have also been repriced downward.  Representative of that, I’ve shown in the bottom left panel the spreads over Treasuries of Ford Motor Credit and GMAC bonds since July 23.  The spreads for both have widened sharply in the two weeks, particularly for Ford, which was hit by rumors of a possible downgrade.  The 7¼ percent bond of 2011 widened from 350 to 450 basis points, and other Ford bonds rose to as high as 500 basis points over Treasuries in the past few trading days.  The bottom right-hand panel depicts the bid-asked spread, expressed in basis points, for the same two bonds shown at left.  This spread in a normal environment might be 2 or 3 basis points.  By late July it had already widened out to 5 basis points for GMAC and 10 basis points for Ford Motor Credit.  The spreads then ballooned to 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, in the first seven or eight trading sessions in August.    As the equity markets declined and fixed income markets turned volatile, the price of insurance expressed by implied volatilities rose.  The top panel on page 3 graphs the implied volatility on the S&P 100 equity index, which had been rising steadily since late May but spiked higher in July and peaked at about 50 percent in late July and again in early August.  This is slightly higher than the peaks reached in 1998 and higher than the peak in September 2001 after the terrorist attacks.  The middle panel shows the volatility index for short and intermediate swaptions.  These are implied volatilities on options that give the holder the right but not the obligation to exercise and roll into an interest rate swap.  These instruments are used extensively in hedging operations, especially by mortgage investors.  Both indexes have hit very high levels recently.  The short-term swaption index has nearly doubled to almost 45 percent.  By way of comparison, that index peaked at about 20 percent in 1998 and at 36 percent in the aftermath of September 11.  The intermediate-term index is also at elevated levels and is currently near levels observed in October 1998.  In contrast, implied volatilities on currency options rose in late June but quickly began to trend lower again.  None of the three major currency pairs is now near the peak levels observed in either 1998 or 2001.  Part of the reason currency volatilities have been restrained is perhaps that speculative positions appear to be relatively small; hence there is less demand by that segment for hedging purposes.  It may also reflect the the major economies are expected to move broadly in sync.  Turning to page 4, the top panel graphs the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar re-indexed to April 1.  The dollar had been falling against all major currencies through mid-June, and it continued to depreciate against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss   5 of 92\f",
      "franc.  But the U.S. dollar actually began to appreciate against the Australian and Canadian dollars, as investors came to view a slowdown in the United States as adverse for major commodity currencies.  More recently, the reassessment of growth prospects in Europe has resulted at least in a pause in the dollar’s trend to the downside against other currencies.  The reduced growth prospects overseas can also be seen in equity markets.  The middle panel depicts changes in the S&P 500 and major global equity indexes since April 1.  All major indexes are lower, though those for France and Germany, with heavy representations of telecom and media firms, have performed worse than the others.  Finally, in the bottom panel is the spread on ten-year minus two-year government yields for the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany.  As growth expectations have come down, the curves have steepened, primarily by virtue of the two-year note declining faster than the ten-year note in each of these countries.  The exception, of course, is Japan, where yields at the short end can’t go any lower than they are now.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations for the System account in this period, and I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations.  I would be happy to take any questions.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What would happen if you were to choose a number of other similarly situated so-called “untainted” companies?  Well, today nobody is untainted, unfortunately.  Would you get the same sort of pattern?  What is very interesting about this is that the widening in the spreads starts on the first of the month.  While I vaguely recall that that’s not the same period in which BBB and high-yield bonds really began to take off against Treasuries, it’s not that far off, is it?  MR. KOS.  This is a very short period; it’s only about two weeks.  Again, these spreads had already begun to rise earlier.  They were then stable for a few days and subsequently began rising again.  If I could approach your question in a slightly different way—I think if we looked at a number of companies, the patterns in their spreads might depend in part not only on perceived creditworthiness but on how much debt they have outstanding.  Ford Motor Credit is, I believe, the largest issuer in the bond market.  It’s a very, very large issuer, and of course, GMAC is as well.  A year or two ago investors wanted to hold these jumbo issues.  They were considered desirable because investors perceived them as having a lot of liquidity.  Now, we know what has happened to some of the jumbo issues like those of WorldCom.  Suddenly investors don’t want to have these big positions on their books.  They actually prefer to have debt  of issuers that don’t come to market that much, which will help to diversify their portfolios.  So to some degree a firm’s having lots of paper out there was perceived to be an advantage from the investor’s perspective two years ago, and it is not viewed as advantageous today. \n",

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Southeast have deteriorated somewhat further across almost all sectors since our June meeting.  I keep looking for positive signs of a pickup in growth, but evidence seems sparse at this point.  One consolation is that activity remains at a relatively high level.   Turning to individual sectors, regional retailers report that sales weakened overall despite an improvement in auto sales.  Manufacturing activity in the Southeast continued lackluster, but executives remain relatively optimistic, and inventories are reportedly balanced in most cases.  Our contacts report that technology spending in the District has generally been restricted to software upgrades, with substantial new investment remaining on hold.  Our growing regional auto industry is one area that continues to invest and expand.  One announcement was unique.  One of our Tennessee directors is a top North American executive for Nissan, and he told us that Nissan plans to increase capacity at their yet-to-be-completed Canton, Mississippi, plant by adding some 1,300 additional jobs even before producing the very first car.  I believe that may be the first time that kind of thing has happened in the United States.  The rest of our regional auto industry also continues to expand, reflecting the strong auto sales nationwide.  Honda is expanding its Lincoln, Alabama, plant and plans to add 2,000 jobs in 2004.  And a number of other such announcements have been made in recent months. Reflecting the slow pace of manufacturing, employment growth in that sector remained modest at best.  However, overall District employment shrank about 0.7 percent, slightly less than in the nation as a whole.  Florida and Georgia did register modest job gains in June, but the  other four states in our District posted job losses.  Despite the lower payroll numbers, the District unemployment rate actually declined 0.2 percent, to 5.2 percent, in June because the labor force  shrank for the second consecutive month.   28 of 92\f",
      "The other positive sector continues to be housing.  Residential markets posted more-moderate growth in recent months, but activity remained at very high levels.  New home construction was essentially flat, and inventories were balanced in most markets.  Home sales rose modestly in June compared with a year ago, and realtors generally anticipate that sales in the third and fourth quarters will exceed year-ago levels.  The chairman of our Bank’s board is a large custom homebuilder, operating in several states, and he reports that the high-end market clearly has softened in a number of cities.  Multifamily housing and commercial real estate remain weak, although some improvement in industrial leasing is showing up in a few markets.  In contrast, as elsewhere, the office market shows no sign of improvement yet, and my inquiries among leading architectural firms have picked up few signs of new activity in the pipeline.  Meanwhile reports from the tourism and hospitality sector were not as upbeat as earlier this year.  Disney says it is operating at 90 percent of normal capacity for this time of year, and visitors appear to be staying for shorter periods and spending less this year compared with last year.  Business travel is still quite weak. There have been some concerns expressed recently about a possible credit crunch, but that isn’t consistent with the information provided by my examiners or what we are hearing  anecdotally.  Consumer lending continues to increase moderately, and the share of problem assets remains relatively low.  In most areas, banks continue to report little growth in commercial loan demand.  And mortgage lenders, not surprisingly, say that they expect continued strong demand from borrowers in the second half of the year. Finally at the regional level, I would note that the only current price pressures showing up are for health care, insurance, and steel.  The impact of the 30 percent tariff on imported steel is particularly pronounced and is being felt in steel prices across the District.  Some car   29 of 92\f",
      "manufacturers and others tell us that they are now facing double-digit increases in prices of imported steel goods.   On the national front, the high-frequency data combined with recent revisions to both the GDP and the productivity statistics are not as encouraging as we might have hoped following our last meeting.  Virtually all forecasts have been revised downward, reflecting lower growth rates for key components such as investment, weaker data on consumer expectations, construction, manufacturing, core capital goods, and all the other things that people have already listed.  My own expectations going into the year were perhaps a bit more modest than some.  But I’ve been disappointed that we are not yet seeing some early signs of building momentum.  As a great believer in technology, I had expected to see more investment spending of that type by now, both to reduce costs and to exploit new product opportunities.  But even that has been slow to get restarted. Putting all the data and the stories together, the picture that emerges for me is one of businesses still very much hunkered down, putting off both investment spending and additions to staff.  Despite that, unemployment, if it does not rise appreciably further, is still at a relatively modest level compared with some other cycles.  One of my economists half jokingly reminded me that current unemployment is actually below some earlier estimates of NAIRU.  The current level of employment is still providing income at levels to support some growth in consumer  spending despite the adjustments taking place there.  And it’s hard to see any big kick from government spending over the period ahead, as growing pressures on revenues and spending at the state and local level are offsetting some of the federal spending that we’re getting.  All things considered, I share the Greenbook’s view that the most likely path over the near term is slow, unexceptional, growth that only gradually moves back toward potential next   30 of 92\f",

      "MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First on the region, our District economy clearly lost momentum in recent weeks.  Both factory shipments and auto sales were flat in July after rising significantly earlier this year.  More broadly, our business contacts from the furniture industry and other principal regional industries tell us that demand is weak and hence factories are reducing output and hiring.  All of this, not surprisingly, is affecting capital spending plans.  I probably had twenty or more people in various manufacturing companies tell me that whatever  little capital spending is going on now is aimed almost entirely at increasing productivity rather than enlarging capacity.  So the manufacturing sector, which of course is a big part of our District economy, clearly is showing signs of weakness, at least for the moment.   Not all of the news in the region is gloomy, though.  Housing activity in our District, as elsewhere, is still strong pretty much across the board.  But business expectations overall in our area are clearly more downbeat and pessimistic than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  These expectations were summed up rather well, I think, by a comment I heard recently from a guy in the furniture industry.  He said the good news was that a recent survey  they had done showed that 67 percent of American households had definite plans to buy furniture.  The bad news was that they didn’t know when.  [Laughter] Turning to the national economy, the period since our June meeting was a remarkably unsettled and, in my view, unsettling period.  Financial markets were obviously nervous and pessimistic, and much of the latest economic data—such as the 10 point drop in the new orders component of the ISM index and the decline in weekly hours in July—rather dramatically confirmed the reluctance of both businesses and households to make future spending commitments.  Taking all of the quantifiable negatives into account, the staff has revised its forecast for the second half down a full percentage point, to 2½ percent.  I think that’s reasonable   42 of 92\f",
      "under the circumstances.  But the softening in the economy in the projection is expected only to delay the recovery not to derail it.  The problem, of course—and I know the staff is well aware of this—is that there are currently an unusually large number of significant downside risks in the outlook that are very difficult to quantify and to incorporate in a forecast.  Those risks include, for example, the possibility of a renewed and perhaps sharper drop in stock prices than we’ve already seen, a war in the Middle East, financial collapse in Brazil, or another terrorist attack in the United States.  There are positives in the picture.  Structural productivity growth still appears to be running above 2 percent.  The Fed has now achieved price stability, and we have in place, I would argue, a highly stimulative monetary policy as indexed by the zero real funds rate.  But these positives may be insufficient to shield the recovery if one of the downside possibilities were actually to materialize. Broadly, the challenge for policy in this situation is that the tentative character of the current recovery—and “tentative” is the word I would use to describe it—makes it very vulnerable to negative shocks, especially with the nominal funds rate near the zero bound.  Since we’ve achieved credible price stability, I think it’s reasonable and natural for us to ask whether we might ease policy today to speed the economy up just a bit and reduce that vulnerability to an unanticipated negative shock. Last November I strongly favored a preemptive policy easing in the situation we faced at the time.  But I would not favor such a move today.  I think there are significant differences in  the two situations.  Back in November we were still responding to the immediate fallout from recession and a substantial widening in the output gap that threatened a big acceleration in  disinflation and, with the proximity to the zero bound, actually posed the risk of deflation.  We   43 of 92\f",
      "haven’t experienced another shock like September 11 at this point, and both the unemployment rate and the output gap, at least for now, are relatively stable.  Again, the real funds rate is already at or near the zero level.  Our experience with go-stop monetary policy in the past—and this goes to a point that Tony made a minute ago—teaches us that the Fed isn’t likely to be able to speed up the recovery by making the real funds rate negative without sowing the seeds of future inflation.  We haven’t talked about that much lately, but that can happen.  Too much monetary stimulus could sow the seeds of inflation that over time could destabilize the economy—maybe not in the near future but at some point down the road. I can think of circumstances where we might want to ease.  If inflation drifts down, we obviously should reduce the nominal funds rate to prevent the real funds rate from rising.  If the disinflation were sharp enough, I think we should consider reducing the real funds rate below zero temporarily to preempt deflation.  And if we experience another substantial negative shock that disrupts financial markets, then too we should consider making the real rate negative to preempt the widening of the output gap that again would pose a risk of deflation.  But we’re not faced with any of these conditions yet, as I see it.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. MOSKOW.  I have a question for you, David, about the discussion on productivity in your remarks today and also the alternative scenario with faster productivity growth included in the Greenbook.  You talked about two possible explanations for this extraordinary growth in productivity.  One is that structural productivity has increased, and you deal with that in the alternative scenario.  The second is that employers have employees working harder, and I think you added organizational efficiencies to that as well.  Some research we’ve done in Chicago would suggest that if employers are having employees work harder, employees also are going to be working longer hours.  But, of course, as you said, the hours worked have been drifting down, and overtime hasn’t increased significantly.  So I’m just wondering how you reconcile those facts with this favored explanation of the higher increase in productivity growth?  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent?  Obviously, you have been convincing as usual.  I think there’s an emerging consensus within this group as to how we ought to be looking at the economy and policy.  In this regard, I believe it’s important to summarize a few developments and list various alternatives that we confront. First, I think it’s fairly evident that unprecedented levels of equity extraction from homes have exerted a strong impetus on household spending.  We see this in the incoming aggregate data on such spending, though not in measures that reflect consumer attitudes and psychology.  We know, for example, that the level of existing home turnover is quite brisk and that the average extraction of equity per sale of an existing home is well over $50,000.  A substantial part of the equity extraction related to home sales, which is running at an annual rate close to $200 billion, is expended on personal consumption and home modernization, two components, of course, of the GDP. The long duration of the currently elevated level of home sales is a bit of a puzzle.  At some point it has to drift down to a more normal range, but it’s not doing so thus far.  Similarly,  the historically high level of refinancings in the third quarter, as reflected in the data on applications reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association, is creating a very large increase in cash-outs. We estimate that they, too, are running in the $200 billion range at an annual rate, up very significantly from where they were a year or eighteen months ago.  Perhaps more importantly, there is no evidence of a slowing in refinancing activity.  The average rate on new  thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is well below the average rate on outstanding mortgages.  This differential plays an important role in models of refinancing activity constructed here at the Board.  The models, which fit the historical data very well, suggest that refinancing activity should continue quite strong in the months immediately ahead.  Accordingly, we are likely to see 78 of 115\f",
      "fairly high levels of actual cash flows, the monies made available from the cash-outs, until the end of the year and perhaps beyond. The impact of this development is not easy to isolate from the rest of what is going on in the economy, but there is no question that a goodly part of the robustness of household expenditures stems from this source.  Cars and light trucks, which have been quite strong, are examples of the types of large ticket items that are disproportionately purchased when equity is extracted from the sale of a home.  It seems likely that increases in the average size of cash-outs will persist, and one would expect these monies to have an impact on purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items.  Indeed, I suspect that’s what we are seeing. It’s hard to know how long this process can go on, as Governor Ferguson mentioned.  In my view, it has been induced to a substantial extent not so much by the level of the thirty-year mortgage rate but by the fact that the rate has been falling at a fairly pronounced pace.  Our models on existing home sales actually suggest that the level of the mortgage rate is what determines the level of existing home sales; but this is a complex issue, and it remains to be seen whether in fact the net change in the mortgage rate has an impact on sales.  Obviously, it must have an impact on refinancings because, if the rate on new mortgages stays under the average rate on outstanding mortgages for an extended period and fosters heavy refinancing activity,  those two rates must converge.  And as they converge, the propensity to refinance must invariably fall. There is some evidence of modest slippage in the sale of motor vehicles after the quite riveting increases in such sales in July and, even more surprisingly, in August.  Through the first twenty days of September, motor vehicle sales slipped back but they continue to be well above 79 of 115\f",
      "normal in that we are still seeing sales in the area of 16½ million units, a total that would have been viewed as bizarrely excessive a couple of years ago.   We saw a fairly pronounced drop in last week’s chain store sales, which is consistent with the reports we’ve heard around the table.  However, I must caution you that those chain store sales figures are not all that useful as indicators of overall merchandise sales, especially the weekly data that we look at.  Motor vehicle sales obviously are as close to an exact number as we  get in economic statistics, and the estimates we are talking about basically come directly from the motor vehicle manufacturers.  Indeed, it is essentially their tabulations, car for car, that appear in the personal consumption expenditures component of the GDP.  So in appraising consumer spending, there is a very big difference between motor vehicle sales and chain store sales.  One is really accurate; the other is close to dubious.  Even so, the fact that both are moving in the same direction is suggestive in my view of some slowing in the growth of overall retail sales. Another positive element in the outlook is the fact that inventories are getting tight.  Our weekly industrial production data suggest a very modest increase for the month of September but probably not enough to prevent some inventory liquidation from continuing.  I say “continuing” because I frankly don’t believe the latest book value figures that we have.  The reason I say that is that the inventory patterns that we get from the industrial production index together with our efforts to track the movement of goods indicate that, after some buildup in the second quarter, inventory accumulation turned decidedly negative in July and August.  That in turn is consistent with the fact that industrial production has flattened out quite significantly even though industrial consumption still seems to be rising.  What all this indicates is that the GDP data and the industrial production index are telling us different stories.  Indeed, when we endeavor to infer 80 of 115\f",
      "activity in the industrial sector from the GDP data, we find that it is rising relative to our official industrial production numbers.  To be sure, there is a question as to which is the more accurate estimate.  A fairly significant part of the initial monthly estimate of the industrial production index is based on the hours data and the judgments that we make concerning productivity.  We  can’t be certain about its accuracy but, as Dave Stockton points out, the anecdotal information does seem to be more consistent with the slower pace of industrial activity indicated by our index  than is inferred from the goods and structures components in the GDP data, taking out the GDP system.  I conclude that we are dealing with a fairly tight inventory situation, which is a plus in that we also have, as was mentioned before, fairly good liquidity in the corporate sector.  In a sense this economy is in a position to move forward if a number of the negatives that I will get to shortly are removed.            Another obvious positive is the behavior of the productivity data.  I, at least, believe it’s an unequivocal positive, although the employment figures clearly are not. It’s really quite startling to see how significant the productivity numbers are.  In the GDP accounts, we tend to look at the product data, and those data are showing fairly strong increases.  Nonfarm  productivity was up 4.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.  Did you say you’re using 4 percent for the current quarter, David?   \n",

      "MR. PARRY.  No, it has not.  But both sides made concessions to reach an agreement on technology, and that has been the major stumbling block.  There are other issues, but that’s the major one.  Although talks still could break down over pensions and arbitration, clearing the technology hurdle substantially eased tensions between the two parties.  That being said, operations at West Coast ports have yet to return to normal.  The pace of work remains well below capacity at ports throughout the West.  And in some ports, the backlogs of container ships have hardly shrunk at all since the workers returned in early October.  This is particularly true at LA/Long Beach, which of course is the largest port.  Only the port of Seattle has completely recovered from the lockout, having no ships queued in the harbor at the present time.  More generally, congestion, truck and railcar imbalances, and periodic work disruptions have delayed deliveries and shipments and boosted freight costs for many District businesses.  Companies have reported that deliveries and shipments are running one to four weeks behind schedule.  The largest delays are for automobiles moving through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  Ongoing disruptions have prompted some retailers to accelerate their shipment schedules in order to get merchandise in stores for the holiday sales season.  In a preemptive move, Target stores reportedly chartered a ship in Asia in mid-October and moved cargo to be sold in the Angeles and Long Beach three to four weeks before it needs to have the goods in its stores.  With shipping problems continuing, we are hearing many reports of congestion fees for the use of ports, rising truck and warehousing costs, and the near doubling of airfreight charges for new clients. Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data have been disappointing. The 3.1 percent growth rate for third-quarter real GDP was not very encouraging, given the large   26 of 122\f",
      "contribution from the temporary surge in autos.  Moreover, both business investment and personal consumption expenditures weakened as the quarter progressed, even outside of motor vehicles.  And, of course, the October employment report provided little reason to believe that this period of weakness is behind us. While our near-term forecast remains somewhat higher than that in the Greenbook, the revisions since September are similar.  We have revised down growth in the current quarter by more than 1 percentage point, to 1¾ percent.  We continue to believe that we are likely to see a   modest expansion in the economy next year.  However, recent developments dimmed prospects somewhat for the first half of next year.  The recent weakening in capital goods orders is especially worrisome since capital goods investment is critical to a rebound in economic activity next year.  Overall in our forecast, real GDP growth does not rise above its potential rate until the second half of next year, and the economy ends 2003 with considerable excess capacity.  Under these circumstances, we expect inflation to trend down, with the core PCE index rising by 1½ percent in 2003 and 1¼ percent in 2004.  I would add, somewhat similar to what Dave talked about in terms of the Greenbook, that analysis at our Bank—based on historical inflation forecast errors—finds that the risk of outright deflation in 2003 and 2004 appears to be quite small.  It seems to me that the case for easing policy is strong.  There is little inflation threat, recent data have been weak, and significant geopolitical risks appear to weigh on the economy.

      "MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The information we have suggests that our District economy, like other regional economies around the country, softened in October from an already quite moderate pace over the summer months.  Some of this weakness in our region reflected unusual special circumstances.  We do a monthly survey of District conditions,  and it indicated that retail sales and shopper traffic both dropped off very sharply in the month of Baltimore/Washington/Richmond corridor away from malls during much of that month.  But there had already been signs of some slippage in retail sales earlier, in September.  And the survey I mentioned suggests that activity is more sluggish now than it was several months ago in a number of service-sector industries, especially in the northern part of our region.   In manufacturing, according to our survey information, factory output held steady in Cathy, the anecdotal information for the most part is pretty bearish.  There are some bright spots, though, in the information we’ve received most recently.  One particularly interesting comment I heard was made to me by the chairman of the CSX Railroad, who simply because of the nature of his business has a broad range of contacts across a number of manufacturing and other industries.  He told me that his sense from the conversations he has been having is that, barring further big negative shocks, the recovery is poised to accelerate by early next year.  So at least somebody has some sense of positive animal spirits out there.  As a number of people have mentioned for their Districts, housing activity still shows no signs of decelerating.  So that’s the news on the region. On the national economy, for most of this year it seemed reasonable to think of the economy as moving forward with a relatively small and more or less stationary output gap.    35 of 122\f",
      "Especially since the middle of the year, aggregate hours have been flat, and the growth of demand has been pretty much matched by the continuing strong growth of productivity.  In this situation, at least until recently, I thought it was plausible to expect that with the real funds rate near zero, disposable personal income growing at a reasonably strong pace, and profits showing some signs of gradually increasing, an adjustment process was in place.  And it seemed likely to me that, given time, this process would help overcome the reluctance of business firms to invest, eliminate the output gap, and put the economy back on a solid and reasonably balanced growth track.  The information we’ve received in the last several weeks, of course, has called that view  into question.  After having been very mixed for most of the year, the latest data are speaking more uniformly, and they suggest that the output gap is, if anything, growing rather than shrinking.  The growth of consumer spending has decelerated.  The expected rebound of business investment now looks further off than we had hoped.  All of this, of course, is reflected in your forecast, David, which suggests that the output gap is likely to grow through about the middle of next year before it finally begins to narrow.  So the downside risk in the outlook clearly has increased, and I recognize that.  That said, and I may be the lone voice in the wilderness, I think we need to be careful not to exaggerate the increase in the downside risk or to overreact to it.  I think monetary policy, and here I would disagree with you a bit, Cathy, is still quite stimulative.  Moreover, it is expected to remain stimulative for some time, and that expectation is holding longer-term interest rates down.  Productivity growth, as I think you mentioned, David, is likely to remain robust for the foreseeable future.  That may restrain both job growth and wage increases temporarily, but it should help to increase corporate cash flow and equity valuations and provide at least internal financial resources, which at some point, hopefully not too far down the road, may help business   36 of 122\f",
      "firms overcome their reluctance to invest.  You also mentioned that the stock market was showing some signs of stabilizing; some of the imbalances that we’ve been grappling with appear to be diminishing.  And while I know there are a lot of difficulties on the docks, as Bob Parry has described very well, that kind of longer-run uncertainty may have been resolved to some extent.  Further—and I think especially importantly for monetary policy—while we may be experiencing some further disinflation, currently it does appear to be pretty mild.   So I think we should take the time to assess the persistence of the recent slowing in the recovery and its likely cumulative impact on the output gap before we react to it.  I know, of course, that the markets and the broader public expect us to reduce the funds rate this morning. Consequently, if we didn’t do that—if we disappointed those expectations—there would be some  short-term cost.  But I believe there is also a longer-term risk that adding additional monetary stimulus now to what we already have in place could create doubts that we will be prepared to reverse course promptly when the economy eventually begins to strengthen. \n",

      "MR. MCTEER.  I want to update a little story that I told you a meeting or two ago; I’ve been wondering since Jerry Jordan spoke if this had any relevance to his comments.  I had mentioned that several maquiladoras along the Tex-Mex border on the Mexican side had left to go to China to take advantage of lower wages there than in Mexico.  Our staff has identified at  least eight that made that move who have since returned because they didn’t find the quality of labor in China up to standards.  In one of those instances, the Chinese government kept the equipment and machinery, took it apart to see how it worked, and couldn’t get it back together.  [Laughter]  That might curb the outflow in the future. In the Eleventh District economy there’s not much pumpkin.  [Laughter]  At our meeting in late September I reported that growth in the Eleventh District had stalled over the previous two months.  As indicated in the latest Beige Book and by recent economic data, the Texas economy has shown signs of contracting over the last six weeks.  Our regional economy had exhibited tentative signs of improvement earlier in the year, but the information from the second and third quarters suggests that we’re still in recession.  Employment has declined for five consecutive months, and the unemployment rate has been stuck at 6.1 percent for the last three months.  The economic mood expressed at our board of directors meetings over the last two months has been somber at best.  Beige Book contacts indicate that all sectors of our economy are moving backward with the exception of agriculture.  More disturbing is the fact that our contacts were virtually uniform in their description of current conditions and the outlook for the remainder of the year.  Usually we get a mixed picture, with some companies and industries moving forward while others are regressing, but not this time.   The Eleventh District has been weaker than the nation partly because of our concentration in high-tech manufacturing industries and in energy, both of which have continued   50 of 122\f",
      "to contract in recent months.  Construction is more of a mixed picture.  And like the rest of the country, residential activity is holding up pretty well but commercial vacancy rates are rising sharply. Turning to the nation, since our September meeting the national economy has also weakened somewhat.  Again, using the Beige Book as the source, three Districts reported firmer economic conditions.  Most of the remaining Districts characterized economic activity as remaining soft or as having deteriorated.  My own view of the national economy is captured in New York’s summary:  “The economy shows further signs of slowing while prices of goods and services were reported to be flat to down slightly.”  The statistics reinforce this picture of an economy on the ropes.  Declines in retail sales and in capital goods orders and shipments stand out.  But declines in industrial production and in the leading economic indicators, along with a deep plunge in consumer confidence, are also worrisome.  Last week’s job report—the establishment survey is the one that we should be looking at—suggests that we’ve had negative job growth so far during this past year of what presumably is a recovery. My economists tell me that in forecasting inflation a naive forecast does about as well on average as more-sophisticated techniques.  That being the case, I’ll assume that inflation over the next six months will be close to what it has been over the last six months.  And there seem to be no recent developments in the economy that would suggest that inflation is likely to accelerate.  If anything, a slowing economy together with the way that productivity has been holding up suggests slightly lower inflationary pressures in the months ahead. At our last meeting I suggested that we needed to ease by 50 basis points.  The evidence that has become available since then reinforces that feeling.  Some people, including some at our   51 of 122\f",
      "Bank, are more concerned than I am that a negative demand shock could cause the disinflation trends we’ve had lately to morph into deflation.   The FOMC has avoided inflation targets being thrust upon it by political mandate.  In essence the Congress has given us the discretion to set our own inflation targets largely because they’ve trusted us to do the right thing.  If we were to allow a situation to develop in which the U.S. economy experienced deflation, the Congress would be likely to impose inflation targets on  us and they likely would be somewhat different from those we might impose on ourselves.  We can debate what we believe to be the current rate of inflation, but I think we would all agree that we’re at or near the lower end of the range that we would set if we did have inflation targets.  Our job right now seems to be to make sure that we don’t go below that floor.   In summary, I think we should ease significantly, primarily to stimulate economic growth and employment growth.  The low and falling inflation rate, with some possibility of deflation, makes the risk of that easing very small. \n",

      "MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the materials that were distributed to you during the coffee break.  As has been true at the past few Committee meetings and as shown in the top right-hand panel of your first exhibit, in the summer of next year. The nadir of the expected path of the federal funds rate is now a touch lower than in August and September (the left-hand and middle panels), although the funds rate ultimately rises to a level that is about the same as was anticipated six weeks ago.  The current situation is unlike that in advance of those previous meetings in another respect, as seen in the middle panels, by the evolution of an estimate of the probability of a ¼ percentage point move as derived from the front-month money market futures contract.  At last night’s close, financial market prices were consistent with a high probability of action today.  Indeed, as seen in the first two columns of the table at the bottom of the exhibit in the summary of the Money Market Services Survey of policy expectations released on Friday, twenty-five of the thirty-six respondents expect policy easing, with fifteen anticipating a cut of 25 basis points and ten looking for a 50 basis point move.  Apparently regardless of the rate action, market participants expect you to retain an assessment of risks balanced toward economic weakness.  Moving further ahead, the majority of respondents expect the funds rate to be at least as low as 1¼ percent in late January, with the balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness.  Thus, the case for holding the funds rate at 1¾ percent today must recognize that, as President Broaddus noted, some market disappointment would attend the announcement of that decision.  But you might be willing to accept that reaction.  As shown in your next exhibit, your aggressive policy actions in 2001 moved the real federal funds rate, the dark line in the upper panel, from around 4¾ percent at the beginning of the year, to about zero by year-end, where it has been held since.  Although estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, represented by the swath of blue in the figure, have also moved down, you’ve kept the real rate below the lower bound of that range.  The red line amid the blue plots one particular estimate, the FRB/US model’s view of the real short rate ultimately consistent with sending aggregate demand to the level of potential output.  The spread of the actual real rate below this estimated equilibrium concept has been sizable for some time.  Indeed, the bottom panel cumulates the effect of that wedge on the quarterly growth of real GDP (at an annual rate), taking into account the model’s assessment of the lags in monetary policy.  According to those estimates, monetary policy stimulus began to kick in only by the middle of last year, as policy easing was initially only offsetting the cumulative effect of the real rate running above its equilibrium value for much of the second half of the 1990s.  The staff model would suggest that policy easing thus far has been adding about 1¾ percentage points to real GDP growth this year.  Given the lags in policy, the Committee’s prior actions will continue to impart sizable, albeit waning, impetus over the forecast period.                                                    2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).   75 of 122\f",
      "You may not be troubled by the assessment that the stimulus to growth of your previous actions will erode if you also believe that the forces currently restraining spending, including the lagged effect of earlier declines in equity wealth, credit stringency both in markets and at banks, and the enervating effects of elevated uncertainty on household and business confidence, will be lifting relatively quickly.  In those circumstances, the current degree of policy accommodation would facilitate a return of the growth of aggregate demand to that of potential output in short order.  But that is not the staff forecast, in which events turn a bit gloomier before that rebound in growth materializes.  A mechanical way of responding to that near-term soft patch is offered in the Bluebook in the policymaker perfect foresight simulations, repeated as your next exhibit.  In this exercise, the FRB/US model with the extended Greenbook assumptions is taken to be a complete, unerring description of the U.S. economy.  As shown in the two upper panels, these simulations entail easing aggressively over the next half year—and then tightening almost as quickly—to work down the resource slack evident in the unemployment rate plotted in the middle panel.  By these calculations, policy ease would be called for even if your implicit inflation target was 1 percent (the red lines), let alone the 1½ percent goal depicted by the green lines.  Indeed, in this framework, policy ease is necessary to prevent inflation from edging below 1 percent, which might otherwise make the conventional estimate of the mean  bias in the PCE inflation rate of 2 percent loom particularly large.  Given the concerns expressed at recent meetings of the potential problems posed, should future adverse shocks necessitate putting the real federal funds rate deeply into negative territory, the Committee might have a preference for more of an inflation cushion than that.  If you were inclined to do so, the extent to which you might ease probably interacts with how you would assess the balance of risks at that new stance of policy, the subject of your final exhibit.  At the top of the exhibit, I’ve listed how the Committee described its disclosure policy when it was introduced in January 2000.  As noted in the first bullet, the Committee has promised that its statement will express its “sense of risks to the attainment of its long-run goals of stable prices and sustainable economic growth.”  However, as in the second bullet, that attainment is assessed over the “foreseeable future,” admittedly an elastic concept about a “relevant” period that may depend on economic conditions.  A complication that several members have noted at the past few meetings is that the balance of risks assessment has the potential to influence investors’ confidence in the economic outlook as well as their expectations of policy.  If so, you might be concerned that a policy action deemed insufficiently stimulative to balance the risks might be undercut by an adverse reaction to the policy statement.  This interaction of  words and action makes it difficult to build the case for easing 25 basis points in that, if you shared the staff’s assessment that economic momentum had flagged, such a move would not likely put the perceived risks back into balance.  It would only be if you viewed the outlook as having deteriorated a bit—but not as much as in the   76 of 122\f",
      "Greenbook—that you might see 25 basis points of “insurance” as fostering a better balance to the risks.  Given the staff’s assessment of the economy, you might see a 50 basis point move as a closer call on balancing the risks.  By way of example, the lower left panels give the FRB/US model’s prediction of what would happen to real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and core PCE inflation were you to lower the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting and hold it at that level thereafter.  This is the “lower funds rate” alternative of the Greenbook, where the blue bars give the alternative results and the red line depicts the baseline outcomes.  As indicated in the box at the right, even after ½ point of ease, the Committee might indicate that the risks were still tilted toward weakness because in the near term—that is, before any effects of action today would plausibly leave an imprint on the economy—resource slack builds.  Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding the forecast might seem to weigh particularly heavily on the downside.  However, as noted at the lower right, the Committee might put particular weight on the observation that, after policy action, aggregate demand is expected to expand considerably faster than aggregate supply in the second half of 2003 and in 2004, an outcome that might be seen to offset the prospect of declining core inflation if the “foreseeable future” stretches sufficiently far.    It is also possible that the Committee might view action today as better balancing the odds of its own future action, despite whether it saw the macroeconomic consequences of an adverse outcome for spending as worse than would attend a positive surprise.  That is, easing today might make it a coin toss as to whether the next move was up or down.  Such an interpretation of the risk assessment, though, might not be seen as progress in your disclosure policy.  Three years ago, the Committee abandoned the old “tilt” in the directive because it had become too rigidly  interpreted in markets as a signal on the next policy action.  That completes my prepared remarks.  \n",

      "MR. REINHART.  As I stated, there are two roles for the balance of risks statement.  One is as an indication on the course of the economy, and the other is an indication of the likely prospects for policy over the foreseeable future.  To the extent that markets focus on the latter and see the risks tilted toward weakness as raising the odds of action in December, then a cut of 25 basis points at this meeting with an unbalanced risk statement is going to get them to price in significant odds of an additional 25 fairly shortly.  \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Not surprisingly, I do think that you’re right, but let me explain why.  It seems to me that it’s very clear from the discussion around the table that we need to take out insurance against the downside risks in the Greenbook forecast and in everybody else’s forecast that I heard.  When one is taking insurance against downside risks, one should take out the amount of insurance that is appropriate; 25 basis points simply is not enough.  First of all, the immediate market reaction to 25 basis points slanted toward weakness would be that the Committee is composed of a bunch of wimps, which is not an attractive assessment for a group that is supposed to be a very important public body.  But second, the market would immediately crank in an assumption of another 25 basis points either in the intermeeting period or at the December meeting, which would be considerably more destabilizing than doing the right thing in one move today.  Why would we say that we’d go with a statement of balanced risks?  Well, if taking out insurance against downside risks is what we’re about, which I think it is, the whole purpose of that is to balance the risks.  If 50 basis points is the right number, it should balance the risks.  If it isn’t the right number, we should use a bigger number, which I don’t think is necessary.  If we did 50 basis points with the balance of risks toward weakness, in the first place I think it would be wrong.  In the second place, it would scare the hell out of everybody.  I can assure you, as your man in New York, that if there’s anything of which I’m certain after many years of being in markets, that would scare them; that would be very, very unwise. Now, I think a legitimate question if we go with 50 basis points and a balanced risk statement is, Does it tie our hands?  I don’t think so.  It certainly doesn’t tie our hands if in fact  we took out insurance and didn’t need it.  That would be good news.  That would be great, and everybody would cheer, starting with us.  So it certainly doesn’t tie our hands in that direction.    85 of 122\f",
      "On the other hand, if at the next meeting or the meeting after that we decided that the situation was deteriorating further and we had to take out more insurance or we wanted to make a more normal non-insurance move, our hands would not be tied either.   So it seems to me that the recommendation that you have given us is the right and prudent thing to do, and it in no way prohibits any action that we may wish to take in the future.  Thank you. \n",

Mr. Chairman, given the uncertainty in the economy, which you described in your remarks, I would accept and in fact would support a move of 50 basis points if we are going to move at all.

Mr. Chairman, starting out with the fifth point, it seems to me that it is a very good staff study, and I hope that it will be released at some point for public comment and discussion.  As for the options suggested for additional study, I favor consideration of the purchase of Ginnie Mae securities.  Where such fully federally guaranteed debt is available, there is a presumption, I believe, that it should be included in our portfolio.  And if I remember correctly, at our previous meeting there was considerable support for looking at that alternative.  I also like the proposal for the ACF.  It seems to me that the experience we would get from the ACF would be useful for creating a contingency ACF if that were needed.

      "MS. JOHNSON.  As we reported in the Greenbook, the staff did not see the developments since the November FOMC meeting as indicating a need for any major revisions to our outlook for economic activity abroad or for the U.S. external sector.  Some new information did prompt marginal changes to our forecast for particular countries, but these small adjustments were largely offsetting. The challenge confronting us as we put together this forecast remained that of ensuring that the overall strengthening in the global economy that we have again presented is consistent with the extent of stimulus we see outside that present in the U.S. economy.  We have become slightly more pessimistic about the outlook for the euro area and have written down real GDP growth in that region by 0.3 percentage point in 2003 and slightly less in 2004.  Most, but not all, of that revision is accounted for by the change in our outlook for Germany.  We see the obstacles to growth in Germany as looming larger than we had previously thought.  German fiscal policy is constrained in the near term by the failure to have made more progress over the past several years in achieving the medium-term goals set out in the Stability and Growth Pact.  The momentum for structural reform within Germany seems to have faded, perhaps because of the politics of the election this year.  There are particular problems in the German banking system that raise questions about the efficiency with which capital is being allocated and that may be impeding a return to more dynamic growth.  And the general weakness in business spending on new capital in Europe and elsewhere works to the disadvantage of Germany’s manufacturing industry—the core of the German economy.  Slight upward revisions to our projections for Mexico and for some of the emerging-market economies in Asia essentially offset our less favorable outlook for the euro area.  These small positive changes were driven by some recent data, which confirmed solid expansion in Mexico and Korea, and by the stronger outlook in this forecast for the acceleration in real output in the United States over the forecast period.  These regions are extremely vulnerable to any weakening in U.S. activity or, for Asia, to any faltering in the recovery of the global high-tech sector.  We have built into the forecast the consequences of the current-quarter slowing now apparent in the United States and elsewhere.  But our slightly more optimistic projection for output growth in 2003 and 2004 in Mexico and emerging Asia reflects the boost to U.S. growth expected from your move at the last meeting.  It is not the consequence of any significantly stronger domestic demand now evident in those foreign economies.  Last Thursday, the ECB Council lowered its official lending rates 50 basis points, bringing the minimum repo rate down to 2.75 percent.  Ahead of the meeting date, members of the Council had signaled the likelihood of this step, and we had incorporated it into the Greenbook forecast.  We are not looking for any further reductions by the ECB and do not expect them to begin moving up rates until mid­2004.  We view rates at the current, rather low, level as necessary for the moderate recovery in growth that we expect will begin next spring.      11 of 87\f",
      "The underlying factors that are the basis of our expectation for moderate  acceleration in the pace of activity abroad are similar to those for the U.S. economy.  Monetary policy is stimulative in several of the major industrial countries, although its effectiveness in Japan remains a concern.  Inventory cycles abroad are well along  and, to varying degrees, we expect will be adding positively to the change in output over the forecast interval.  The restraining effect of lower equity prices on spending, either because of hits to confidence or direct wealth effects, should be waning.  And lower oil prices will reduce headline inflation, boost confidence, and support domestic spending.  Domestic demand has been buoyant in a few cases—such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Korea—and appears to be firming in others.  These factors point to only a moderate pace of recovery in 2003.  Such an outcome should allay concerns that now weigh on spending and support further recovery in growth to more vigorous rates in 2004.  Except in Canada, this projected path for real activity still leaves the level of output below potential in the major foreign industrial countries even at the end of 2004.  We are concerned that there is limited scope outside the United States to react to any new negative economic developments that might arise.  In both Japan and the euro area, options with respect to fiscal policy are severely limited.  But most countries do have room to maneuver with respect to monetary policy should the recovery go off track.  In South America, even a very favorable outcome would not generate positive spillovers elsewhere; at best, we are looking for no major deterioration in Brazil and so no negative contagion problems within the region.  In emerging Asia—the region that has so far displayed the most resilience—there would be some scope for absorbing some external shock to the real economy.  Continued robust growth in China is a stabilizing factor in that region.  Nevertheless, we judge that, were U.S. real GDP not to accelerate as projected in the baseline forecast, the projected strengthening of activity elsewhere in the global economy would be undermined as well.

Well, as you know, partly at your direction, prior to the 2000 Census we had been looking at the possibility that there would be some significant upward revision in the population estimates, and in some sense that certainly had already informed our thinking.

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Second District economy appears to have picked up some steam since my last report, with signs of improvement  in the labor market and stabilization in manufacturing.  Retailers are reporting some  improvement in sales in November, particularly over the Thanksgiving weekend, with the winter weather producing a rebound in apparel purchases.  And the streets of Manhattan were filled with tourists, which we were very happy to see.  Surprisingly, considering all this, consumer confidence remained depressed in November following a big drop in October.  Unemployment rates are about flat; they edged up very slightly in the most recent month.  Sales of existing single-family homes weakened noticeably in October, while selling prices slipped very modestly.  Home construction retreated a bit in October but remains at a fairly high level, particularly in the multifamily sector.  Lower Manhattan’s office market remained stable in October but office vacancy rates in the rest of Manhattan rose further.  Manufacturers and purchasing managers report that conditions generally have been stable in recent weeks.  The fiscal situation in New Jersey, New York City, and New York State has remained very grim indeed.  And we have what I think could now be called a fairly high probability of a transit strike beginning at midnight on Sunday.  The demands by the transit workers are well beyond the ability of the transit authority or the city to accept.  The effect of a transit strike on the city, especially on consumers and tourists, would be very unfortunate.  It looks as if it’s an accident that should be avoided but may very well not be.  The bankers in the District report that residential and commercial mortgages are being increasingly sought and not just refinancings.  They have been tightening up on their lending standards, which is not surprising because delinquency rates on consumer and home mortgage loans have increased some.  We share the view that the fourth quarter will be weak, perhaps even   55 of 87\f",

However, we still think the risks to the forecast are somewhat to the downside, although that’s less clearly the case than at our last meeting largely as a result of our move.  On the international front, I think Karen’s report was as usual very well balanced.  However, the news in Latin America, my early area of specialty, is getting worse.  The Mexican political situation is essentially frozen until next July’s congressional elections.  The president does not wish to negotiate with the opposition, and the opposition doesn’t want to negotiate with  the president, and so nothing will happen.  Fiscal policy cannot be expansive simply because the government can’t find the revenues, and monetary policy has been tightened a little very recently.  In Brazil, the delay in President-elect Lula da Silva’s naming of his Economic Policy Committee is not good news.  I think there is a growing conflict between his economic advisers and the leadership of his labor party.  If it continues, that could result in an additional and unnecessary blow to confidence among both domestic and international investors.  That would keep real interest rates high and, therefore, make the sustainability of the debt levels in Brazil more questionable.  In my view, the risks are not overwhelming, but the direction is not a happy \n",

      "MR. STOCKTON.  Again, from my perspective it’s more a political issue than an economic one because I would not like to sit here at each meeting and tell you that a particular policy is the optimal one.  I don’t believe it’s the staff’s role to say that you should be cutting the funds rate 25 or 50 basis points, or that you ought to be doing that in three or four steps, or that you ought to raise it by a certain amount.  But I think the Greenbook forecast is useful because it is not delivering a result that is significantly at odds with what I perceive to be, roughly speaking, your longer-term policy objectives. In terms of what would happen if we were to pursue this optimal path, the markets clearly are not building in expectations of something that looks like that path.  If anything, as I indicated in my remarks, they’re expecting more tightening.  So in our forecast when you don’t tighten to the extent that the markets currently anticipate as we move into the second half of next year and   2004, that produces some rally in the bond markets.  When the markets see that the economy does not necessarily need that tightening—and they see you are not doing it—they are going to revise down their path for the future expected funds rate.  I don’t think these actions somehow result in a downward revision in the markets’ view, relative to current expectations, about what your longer-run inflation objective is.  So that’s a long-winded explanation of why it is that we don’t use that so-called optimal path as the baseline for the projection. I would just say, however, that I’m open to suggestions.  Obviously, we are trying to produce something that is useful for your deliberations.  But if I were required to produce a forecast that involved taking a strong stand on exactly what the Committee’s objective function looks like, that would be a task fraught with difficulty for me.   \n",

Those expectations aren’t able to clarify whether there is inertia or not.  So it is term structure evidence, but I’m just looking at the very short end—one year or less of the term structure maturities.   But it is true that there is a link.  In what is often called optimal monetary policy inertia, it has been demonstrated in other presentations that, as you have more forward-looking expectations, the monetary authority is able to stabilize the economy, not necessarily by taking actions today but by promising to take actions in the future.  Financial markets build that in, and those expected future actions are able to affect the economy today.  Those actions reflect inertia.  Again, those inertial movements are assumed in optimal monetary policy.  I don’t consider that something we should be taking too seriously.  I don’t think we have the empirical evidence of monetary policy inertia, and I don’t think optimal monetary policy inertia is very convincing. \n",

It might be useful to point out as well that, while policy actions three, four, or five quarters ahead are hard to predict, it’s not that they don’t get built into the term structure.  The Board staff produces an expected path of the federal funds rate based on our readings of the futures markets, and it commonly has policy actions built in at those horizons.  In fact, the current forecast is a good example.  Policy is expected to be on hold until the fourth quarter of 2003 and then, according to our path, about 150 basis points of tightening is built in for subsequent years.  So it’s not that future actions don’t get priced in at all but that they’re not very predictable.  \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This discussion has gone on awhile, so let me make just a few points.  One is that I’d remind Brian Sack that people sat around this table in short-term rates would not get passed through to long-term rates because it would stabilize the economy.  And what we found was that the short-term volatility did feed through to long-term rates over the next three years in part because expectations weren’t very well anchored and seeing the rate move around in an unpredictable way actually did feed through to long-term rates.  There was a paper on this in the staff studies of the new operating procedures. I guess I come out between the two positions in your presentations to a certain extent.  As I’ve observed the Committee over time, I think there are elements of gradualism in its policymaking but not as much as seems to show up in the data.  There are a number of occasions—like 1994, as you’ve pointed out—when the Committee thought it wanted to go some distance but didn’t want to get there really fast because it was worried about financial fragility or other things.  Actually, despite the chart, I think there was a bit of that in early 2001 when, once the Committee started to ease, a number of members thought the Committee probably needed to move the funds rate down a couple of percentage points but it took three or four months to get there.  On the other hand, my observation is that most of the time when we leave this room we think the rate is pretty close to where we believe it needs to be—not very far away—and we’re not looking ahead to long runs of further easing or tightening.  So in that case I agree with Glenn.  I think an important issue is the serial correlation of forecasting errors that Vincent talked about.  We learn slowly over time about the shocks and the way the economy is responding to them.  Those answers reveal themselves to us after the economy is shocked.  We learn over time how big the shock is, and then we react as we get that information.   41 of 195\f",
      "With respect to the strength of our responses to output gaps and inflation gaps, I think the Committee hasn’t been as gradual or as damped in its responses as the equations say it has.  In my view there are a couple of points indicative of biases there.  One is that the Committee has been forward-looking, so we’re really looking at forecasts and not at existing output gaps.  We can often bring information to bear that says that a particular shock will likely go away and we don’t need to react so strongly to it.  So I think the wrong stuff is on the right-hand side of these Taylor rules; the Committee is doing much more than looking at the current levels of those two gaps.  The second point is that these estimates are made on the assumption of a constant inflation target, in this case from 1987 through the present.  I don’t want to get into a discussion of whether it should or should not have been constant.  But I do believe that, from 1987 at least into the second part of the 1990s, the Committee surely did not have a constant inflation target.  A number of the former members of this Committee talked about an opportunistic approach to reducing inflation.  Inflation was higher than it needed to be over the long run, but there wasn’t any extraordinary effort to reduce it.  The models wanted us to be stronger in reducing inflation because they had a lower inflation target than the Committee and the Committee didn’t react to the model’s target but to its own.  I think that biases the results to finding that the Committee didn’t act as aggressively as the models thought it should, when in fact it acted fairly aggressively—and aggressively enough to get some pretty darn good outcomes for the economy over the past twenty years. Having said that, I think there is a valuable lesson embedded here, and it goes to the discussion you were having about policy mistakes.  It’s better generally for policy to act too strongly than too weakly to developing situations.  Serious policy errors have been made when policy doesn’t react aggressively enough to a developing situation.  Examples are the Federal 42 of 195\f",
      "Reserve in the 1970s or the Bank of Japan in the 1990s.  That is the sort of policy error that allows expectations to get out in front.  It allows a spiral to develop that becomes very, very hard to reverse.  If we react too aggressively, that also can be a policy mistake.  But tightening too much because we’re afraid of inflation or easing too much because we’re concerned about deflation or recession is much more easily reversed without cumulating expectational problems getting built in.  So to me the lesson for the Committee from these optimal rules is that we are probably better off being a little too aggressive than being not aggressive enough in terms of the possible consequences for the economy over time.   \n",

      "MR. SANTOMERO.  First let me congratulate Vincent and David for bringing to the table what has been an interesting issue and a worthwhile discussion.  I take two things away from this.  The first is that the English language is a funny thing.  These titles are value laden, and we accept them at times too easily, I think.  I’m taken by the phrase “optimal rule.”  That is, it’s optimal assuming that everyone is backward-looking and not optimal as one might think about in a perfect modeling sense. “Optimized rule” I like better.  It is a slight spin on the other phrase because it actually says we optimized the rule based upon a model that isn’t necessarily optimal in the formation of expectations.  The same is true for “policy perfect foresight,” which we usually shorten into the “perfect foresight” equation.  It isn’t perfect foresight.  It’s a policymaker’s perfect foresight when the other economic agents are not using perfect foresight, and therefore it is by construction not perfect.  It’s not perfectly rational and not even mostly rational.   Now the reason I say that is not to play games with either FRB/US or the English language itself but to recognize that we tend to get ourselves into a game here.  We’re trying to defend ourselves against something called an optimal rule.  It seems that we should be close to it and therefore we should shed the inertia until we’re “there.”  In fact, “there” may be something that is an artifact of the title we gave it, and therefore we have to be a little cautious about getting “there.”  Are we subject to inertia and gradualism or to timidity?  I like that because it really comes to the point of another value phrase in that we wouldn’t want to be timid.  We might want to be gradual, and we might even want to subject ourselves to some inertia, but we wouldn’t want to be timid.  [Laughter]  The reason I raise it that way is that the reality is that we’re dealing in a world in which we seem to observe that we act slowly.  But the rationale for acting slowly was actually put on the table.  We’re not sure about where we are because of data adjustments.  47 of 195\f",
      "We’re not sure exactly of the potency of our actions because of the coefficient uncertainty.  Indeed, we’re a little concerned about the markets’ reaction because of some of the fragility issues.  In such a world, it’s not surprising that we would act slowly.  If in fact the world is as we think we see it, then we may hold steady or make a further move; if it is not, we will reverse an action.  As we move closer, if the world backs off and the rationale for an action is an artifact of the data, we will not have to go as far backwards.   So I think in fact our policy behavior was more symptomatic of an environment of uncertainty than we give ourselves credit for.  In my view, our actual behavior looks more like a rational response to the uncertain world in the dimensions I just laid out.  So rather than try to chase the optimal rule, I suppose my reaction is that we’re probably doing a better job than the optimal rule suggests.  The data from the markets seem to support that notion, as Glenn reported.  Those would be my comments. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  Any further comments to close this discussion?   If not, we have a report from Dino. MR. KOS.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the package of charts that is being circulated.  The first graph shows three-month cash deposit rates in the United States and the euro-area and three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward for both the dollar and the euro.  The cash rates were stable in the intermeeting period, but forward rates declined, particularly for the euro.  The three-month-forward dollar rates traded through cash rates, partly in response to data that became available as the intermeeting period progressed.  Disappointing outlooks from several major corporations and risk aversion driven by geopolitical risks were cited by market participants as reasons that short-term rates were likely to stay low longer than had previously been expected.  Some were even building in further reductions to come.  In the euro area, reduced expectations for growth, changing sentiment about the prospects for structural reform in some major economies, and a stronger euro that might curb exports were cited as reasons that interest rates might decline there.  For nearly two years now euro-area short-term rates have been higher than dollar rates of comparable maturity.  That divergence was not really remarked upon for much of that period.  Long-term capital flows, such as foreign direct investment and equity portfolio flows, more than covered the U.S. current account deficit.  But with those sources drying up more recently, the expected returns on short-term investments have become much more important to the financing of the deficit.  Hence, short-term interest rate differentials have become more of a topic of conversation in markets.  At the longer end, as shown in the bottom panel of page 1, ten-year yields on German and U.S. government bonds recently have shown a rate advantage for the German bonds.  Although that spread has nearly converged as of today, German yields have had an advantage over U.S. yields since May 2002.  In general, an underlying theme in currency markets recently has been the reduction of expected returns on dollar assets.  Turning to page 2, in the past two months the dollar has shown a steady decline against most major currencies, with the decline of the dollar against the euro most pronounced.  The euro has gained about 10 cents versus the dollar in the last two months and is now trading at its strongest level since October 1999.  But the dollar has also been falling against the Swiss franc, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the pound sterling, the Norwegian kroner, the Canadian dollar, the yen, and almost every other currency except the Mexican peso.  Geopolitical concerns in one form or another have been cited as the reason.  But if investors have concerns about Iraq, it’s not clear why European currencies would be immediately attractive.  And if the concern is North Korea, it’s not clear why the yen would have a spark.  Falling                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 61 of 195\f",
      "stock prices in the United States are sometimes mentioned, but European stocks have fallen even more.  One variation on the geopolitical factor that may have a bit more attraction in terms of concerns is the extent of generalized uncertainty.  That explanation suggests that uncertainty among businessmen and investors has led both groups to stay on the sidelines until the air clears with respect to these geopolitical risks.  Given the losses that investors in general have had in riskier assets in the last few years, that yearning to “stay home” is understandable even without the uncertainty generated by event risks.  But if Japanese, European, and other investors stay home and the U.S. current account deficit still needs financing, the result is that pressure builds on the exchange rate—and perhaps even on asset prices.  A second aspect of developments in the last few weeks involves uncertainty about today’s testimony by the incoming Treasury Secretary.  Some market participants had speculated that he might take a different approach toward the dollar policy.  Finally, another underlying theme in the markets was that some influential central banks were reallocating reserves from dollars to euros.    The yen also appreciated versus the dollar despite the continuing stream of bad news out of Tokyo, although the rise in the yen was less pronounced than that of other major currencies.  In part, the cause of the yen’s appreciation may also be related to asset reallocation, this time by Japanese institutions from yen and dollar assets into euro assets.  But another factor may have been the intervention by the Bank of Japan.  Since mid-January, the Japanese monetary authority has intervened very, very quietly in markets.  In total, they have acquired $5.6 billion over that period.  Markets have not caught on to this activity yet, though they will by early next week when the Bank of Japan’s month-end financial statements are released.  As for the dollar’s value more broadly, as shown in the bottom panel, on an effective basis the dollar is roughly back to the middle of its trading range since 1995 and is also at the average of its value since 1985.  While some commentators have taken that as a sign that the currency is perhaps getting close to some sort of equilibrium, others have pointed out that the dollar moves in long multiyear cycles and is prone to overshoot on the upside and also the downside.  Turning to page 3 and moving to domestic markets, there have been some signs of a revival in risk appetites and of easier financing conditions.  But these signs are tentative and perhaps not all that convincing in the end.  The top left panel shows that the investment-grade corporate bond spread has narrowed sharply in the past three months.  Issuance has also shown some signs of picking up.  The top right panel shows a similar pattern of narrower spreads and a pickup of issuance for high-yield bonds.  Although the trends are favorable, the absolute levels of both spreads and issuance still point to markets being not quite back to normal.  The middle panel graphs for the period since January 2000 the monthly corporate bond spread to Treasuries—for investment-grade bonds (in green on the right scale) and for high-yield bonds (in red on the left scale). Spreads are down from their highs for both, but 62 of 195\f",
      "essentially they have retraced the spike after last summer’s corporate scandals and in absolute terms are still on the high side.  Similarly, over a longer perspective, issuance also has stopped growing.  The bottom panel shows aggregate corporate bond issuance—both investment grade and high yield—by quarter for 2001 in red and for 2002 in blue.  In each quarter of 2002 issuance was lower than in the comparable period in 2001.  So far this month, through January 24, issuance has totaled $47 billion compared with nearly $85 billion for the full month last year and more than $100 billion in 2001.  indication of risk aversion. As shown in the top left panel page 4, the two-year yield remains near its record low at about 1.65 percent.  Longer-term yields have declined a bit less, but they, too, remain at low absolute levels.  The result is that the curve has steepened again. The middle panel graphs three views of the curve’s steepness since the blue line shows the ten-year yield minus the three-month rate, and the green line graphs the ten-year yield minus the two-year rate.  Each is at a very steep level and is comparable to the peaks recorded in 1992.  The positive spin on this steep yield curve is that it is forecasting an economic recovery as it did in the early 1990s.  The negative interpretation that some are taking is that longer-term rates, although low in absolute terms, have remained unusually high despite the fall of short-term rates.  In the latter view, that’s either (1) because the return of budget deficits is forecasting a substantially higher supply, which is being priced into the curve, or (2) because foreign investors in particular are demanding a higher rate of return to keep accumulating U.S. assets.  Given the short-end policy rates, that higher rate needed to attract foreign investors is showing up at the long end.  The picture in equity markets has been mixed, with signs of risk appetites recovering early this year.  But with the the bottom two panels, risk aversion seems to have the upper hand there as well.     Turning to the next page, I just wanted to say a few words about some intra-European developments.  The top panel graphs from last November the S&P 500, the DAX, and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index.  In general, despite the rally in the euro, the situation in euro-area markets has not been very rosy—especially in Germany.  The DAX has depreciated more than the S&P and for that matter more than other European indexes.  Germany has been criticized in the markets for moving too slowly on structural reform and for letting its finances breach the Stability Pact threshold.  Somewhat less noted among analysts has been the compression of spreads relative to Germany among European sovereign bonds.  French government bonds have traded close to German bonds for some time.  But Italian and Spanish bonds, which were traditionally grouped in the so-called periphery—and typically yielded 2 to 3 percent more than German paper before the launch of the euro—have seen their spreads compressed.  As shown in the bottom panel, despite Italy’s budget problems, its sovereign debt is now trading less than 20 basis points over Germany’s.  Spanish government bonds are trading on par with France’s, at only a handful of points over 63 of 195\f",
      "Germany’s.  A number of market participants have noted that Spain has actually moved among the fastest in the EU on the structural reform side.  Turning to page 6, I have just a few quick words on reserves.  The graph there shows the composition of the System Open Market Account in terms of its three main components—the permanent SOMA, long-term RPs, and short-term RPs acquired since January 26, 2002.  You’ll recall that after currency unexpectedly drained reserves in the fall, the Desk compressed the System’s balance sheet, mainly by reducing the size of the long-term repo book to $6 billion.  As we moved toward year-end, a more normal seasonal pattern of currency growth emerged, and the Desk accommodated that primarily by expanding the long-term repo book back up to $26 billion.  As the seasonal pattern reversed, the long-term repo book has been taken down to $14 billion, a level we feel comfortable maintaining for the time being.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I would be happy to take any questions.  \n",

I think two very important events occurred yesterday that affect which of the likely Iraq scenarios will play out.  One was obviously the State of the Union speech by the President.  The other, which may be equally important, was that President Putin of Russia gave a clear signal that the Russians are shifting their view.  If they do shift, the European powers that have been giving us a bad time in the United Nations will be faced with becoming irrelevant, which usually gets their attention.  Therefore, I think it is very likely that we will have the one-month successful war scenario sooner rather than later.

      "VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Indeed.  That’s exactly where I’m going.  If there is a successful modern regime and there is reform, that would be wonderful.  The question is, Will the reform be benign?  Will it take place over an orderly period of time, therefore allowing that part of the world to modernize and become a seat of stability and of growth for the world?  Or will we see regimes that simply are not capable of changing and thus will be toppled, in which case we could have year after year in this Committee a question of what is going to happen in the oil-producing areas?  I think we have to remember that. That’s not going to affect us for the rest of this year or maybe next year, but it will be a challenge to the Committee over time. Let me shift to another area, following up on the exchange rate discussion.  One of the things that the dollar’s strength depends on—against the background of a huge, and in my view unsupportable over time, current account deficit—is whether the people of the world have confidence in world leadership, which is not completely but very largely American leadership.  For whatever reason, our leadership is not providing a very clear view of the way we would like to see the world economy functioning.  Sometimes when that happens, people do some very unfortunate things.   So, my question is to Karen, and it relates to what is going on in South America at the moment.  The International Monetary Fund has decided—their staff was pushed by the member nations to do something that the staff thinks is unwise, and I agree with them—to reward Argentina for a violation of the most basic rule of law, which is that one is supposed to pay one’s debts.  Argentina has been rewarded by a rollover of its obligations so it can pretend to be current with the IMF and other international institutions.  At the same time, across the river Plata, the Uruguayans have been trying very hard to do the right thing—not quite making it but 92 of 195\f",
      "certainly putting forth a very good effort.  But the IMF has decided that Uruguay may not be able to pay its debts in a couple of years, so why not have Uruguay declare default now.  I might just add that the econometric models used by the Fund in this analysis have conditions that probably would make the United States look potentially bankrupt.  Put those two cases together.  One country does everything wrong and is rewarded by the IMF saying we’ll roll over your debt.  The other poor little country tries to do everything right—and like the rest of us isn’t perfect—and the IMF decides that it will not allow them to pay their debts but, in effect, requires them to default.  Let’s move slightly north into Lula da Silva’s Brazil.  When the international community is saying to one nation that it’s okay if you don’t pay your debts—and to another that if you try like the devil to pay your debts and aren’t quite perfect, you should default—why should Brazil jump through hoops and pay its debts?  They can figure that out.  My question is this:  Is anybody in this capital at the International Monetary Fund or anywhere else realizing what I’m convinced is a signal to all the emerging-market countries that the rules have changed? \n",

      "MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Twelfth District economy continued to expand in recent weeks but at a very modest pace.  Consumers turned in a disappointing performance during the holidays, and early numbers for January suggest that they remain hesitant and price conscious.  One retail consultant characterized the current environment as a “race to the bottom,” with consumers willing to hold out until they get goods at cost.  Retailers have responded—offering nearly continuous sales, rebates, financing incentives, and price guarantees.  District businesses also are looking for bargains, especially in real estate and IT support services.  One commercial landlord said he fields daily calls from tenants threatening to move if their lease rates are not lowered.  A contract manager at SUN Microsystems reported increased pressures to lower prices for long-term service contracts and one-time technical support. Now, let me say a few words about the state budget crises.  The genesis of these crises, not only in the West but elsewhere as well, appears to be overly optimistic revenue expectations and, to a lesser extent, cost overruns.  Revenues are running well below expectations, with especially large shortfalls in states dependent on capital gains revenues.  On the cost side, Medicaid seems to be the main culprit due to rapid increases in prescription drug prices and provider fees.  Although a recent survey of state governors found that twenty-four believed their fiscal crisis is the worst in the nation, it appears that things are especially bad in the Twelfth District.  [Laughter]  District states account for approximately 21 percent of gross state product, but they account for about one-half of the estimated total state budget shortfall in the United States.  Of course, California’s gap is the largest—$26 billion or $35 billion depending on whom you talk to—and that’s for both this and the next fiscal year. 104 of 195\f",
      "While these budget shortfalls pose significant challenges for state lawmakers, their economic impact is less clear.  For one thing, estimated budget shortfalls represent the difference between desired spending and current revenues.  They do not represent budget deficits.  Therefore, they typically overstate the tax increases and cuts in spending that are required to balance the budget.  For example, California has a projected shortfall, at least as projected by the governor, of $35 billion.  But it actually faces a deficit of $15 billion.  For another, states usually spread the pain of budget deficits over several years, tempering the immediate impact on state spending and employment growth.  That being said, there are real costs to such large budget shortfalls.  California’s bond rating was downgraded in part because of the announcement of a $35 billion budget shortfall.  With the recent downgrade, rating agencies now score California’s current fiscal crisis as equivalent to that faced during the state’s severe recession in the early 1990s.  Moreover, the state faces severe cash flow problems, so it probably will need to take on more debt to meet current payment obligations.  On the brighter side, exporters and importers breathed a sigh of relief last week on word that a new West Coast port contract had been signed.      Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data have been mixed, with employment and industrial activity on the weak side and consumer spending doing fairly well.  On balance, though, the data have been somewhat disappointing.  Our forecast for this year looks a lot like the one in the Greenbook.  We’ve revised down our estimates of real GDP growth in the fourth and current quarters about ¼ percentage point, to ½ percent and 2½ percent respectively.  Assuming a constant funds rate this year, the most likely scenario for the third and fourth quarters is that real GDP growth will rise above the potential rate by ½ to 1 percent, depending on what happens with fiscal policy.  The excess capacity in the economy brings 105 of 195\f",
      "consumer inflation down at a gradual pace, and inflation in the core PCE price index falls to about 1¼ percent in 2004.   I have some concerns about this outlook.  First, of course, the long-anticipated pickup in growth has yet to materialize.  This pickup seems to depend importantly on an acceleration in business fixed investment occurring before consumer spending falters.  The longer the growth has to depend on the auto and housing sectors, the riskier the situation becomes especially in the context of geopolitical uncertainties.  Second, even the projected expansion is modest at best, and it still would leave the economy with excess capacity through the end of next year.  This brings me to my third concern.  Our forecast also would leave us with an inflation rate next year that’s below 1 percent after taking out the estimated bias.  In my view, that inflation rate is slightly on the low side.   To see how these concerns play out in the longer-run forecast, we ran a number of perfect foresight simulations as in the Bluebook.  We used a couple of different models, including FRB/US, and some alternative assumptions about FOMC policy preferences, including different assumptions about interest rate smoothing and also the degree of responsiveness to the output gap.  In all cases where we assumed a target for measured core PCE inflation of 1½ percent, the optimal policy involved significant near-term funds rate decreases.  These simulations nicely capture the implications of our current situation.  We have excess capacity, prospects for only a modest increase in real GDP growth, and a fairly low inflation rate.  Adding any downside risks for economic activity to this picture would only strengthen the argument that perhaps a further easing of policy might be appropriate before too much more time passes.

      "MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our District economy has been fairly sluggish overall since the last meeting, and I have a sense that there probably has been some deterioration in both household and business confidence.  The cold weather may be part of it.  It was colder in Myrtle Beach the other day than in Anchorage, if I’m not mistaken.  [Laughter]  I think concern about Iraq is restraining household and business spending in our region as elsewhere in the country.  Consumer spending in our District seems to have followed what I understand to be the same pattern that has been reported for other parts of the country—generally weak holiday sales but a revival of automobile sales in December as some of the incentive programs were reintroduced.  We have a director in Charlotte who runs a huge car dealership in North Carolina.  He said that December was a spectacular month.  He’s a pretty sharp guy, and he speculated—I guess based on conversations he’s had with some of his customers—that people are deferring or even forgoing purchases of other major items in order to take advantage of the car deals before they go away again.   Labor markets, in keeping with what I’ve already said, appear to have softened further in our area.  We hear more reports of layoffs.  Unemployment rates are rising in all of our District states.  The majority of the layoffs are at factories, and general manufacturing remains rather weak in our region.  In such an environment, not surprisingly, the information we have on business investment suggests that it’s still quite soft.  We have heard a few reports of increased spending on computers for upgrading and that sort of thing, but nothing much beyond that.  The only vigorous and bright spot in the District is housing.   On the national economy, maybe in some contrast to Bob Parry, I think the staff has made a good case—both in the Greenbook and also in response to Cathy’s question a minute ago—for its projection.  The Greenbook forecast as a point forecast is as plausible as any I can 107 of 195\f",
      "think of.  It basically says that the recovery will gradually, or maybe a bit more than gradually, strengthen over the projection period.  As I see it, the two principal underlying fundamentals that support the forecast are the same two main factors that have been supporting the recovery, such as it is, up to this point—an accommodative monetary policy and strong productivity growth.  We have eased monetary policy substantially over the last two years as a whole, including the most recent move in November.  I think, as the Greenbook says, there’s a good chance that we haven’t seen the full impact of that yet. With respect to productivity growth, as has already been suggested here today, obviously there’s no guarantee that the elevated structural productivity growth of recent years will continue this year and next year.  On the other hand, I don’t see any strongly compelling or obvious reason to think that it won’t continue.  I believe there’s a good chance that it will continue for reasons that you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, in your speech on productivity to the AEI in October of last year.  If it does, that would support continued strong growth of disposable household income and spending and presumably at some point would stimulate, or at least help to stimulate, business investment.  Another source of support is the fiscal stimulus.  I wouldn’t give as much weight to that as I think the staff does, but certainly it’s in the right direction.   Nevertheless, I consider the Greenbook’s point forecast plausible.  I also think that the confidence interval around it is symmetrical but exceedingly wide, mainly because of Iraq.  We’ve had some discussion of this already.  It’s rare, at least in my memory, that the near-term economic outlook has been so heavily dependent on the prospect and timing of one contingent event.  If we invade in the next few weeks and the war is short, successful, and decisive, both business investment and the overall recovery could strengthen quickly and markedly.  I enjoyed very much the part of the chart show that dealt with that.  Also, we could get the same result if 108 of 195\f",
      "somehow this impasse is resolved without an invasion. There is still some small possibility of that, though it doesn’t seem very likely now.  But in either of those situations I think our current policy stance would be much too accommodative.   However, if we do invade and the war triggers some other crisis like another terrorist attack somewhere, then confidence could be eroded further, businesses could continue to restrain investment, and the recovery then would become even more vulnerable to some of the downside risks that have been mentioned here today.  In such a situation, we might need to ease further, and we might need to do so aggressively—or preemptively if I may use that word—even taking account of some of the tradeoffs and tough choices we’d have to make, as we discussed yesterday.  In any case, given the unusual degree of uncertainty in the outlook and the wide range of possibilities, the key point for policy—particularly against the background of our discussion yesterday and with all due respect to prudence—is that we may have to adjust policy substantially and promptly in one direction or the other in the months ahead.  In my view we need to be prepared for that possibility. \n",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One of the things I’ve observed in various committees I’ve been on and in other decisionmaking situations is the difficulty of knowing what you know and knowing what you don’t know.  This meeting strikes me as one of those cases where understanding that difference is key.  Just to review what we know, it is primarily what has happened in the recent past and, as many of you already described, the data have been quite mixed.  What we don’t know is whether or not that recent past is a precursor to a further slowing going forward or indeed, as is consistent with the Greenbook forecast, a precursor to some growth.  It strikes me that the risk of renewed slowing is not sufficient at this stage to warrant any action by the Committee today.  To put it another way, although the dichotomy between the recent past and the forecast for the future is quite palpable, at this time I would place some reasonable odds on something along the lines of the baseline forecast as being generally correct.   There are a number of reasons for that judgment.  One is that monetary policy continues to be, I think, reasonably accommodative.  I believe fiscal stimulus is in the pipeline or soon will be.  Inventories–sales ratios are quite low.  We see some anecdotal evidence to suggest that demand for replacement investment is emanating from various businesses and may actually show through.  That’s the fundamental sense of what we know from the recent past.  What we don’t know is what the future is going to look like.  But in that regard I’d say that the staff forecast is not unreasonable.  Obviously, the other thing we don’t know is the impact of the geopolitical uncertainties.  I think the effort the staff has made in the work put forward by Sandy Struckmeyer is very useful and quite instructive.  But we really are confronting a great deal of uncertainty there.   134 of 195\f",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Dino, on page 2 you’ve shown us both the two-year swap rate and the policy rate for various countries.  I’m trying to understand if there is any policy implication or meaning in the relationships we see in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia versus those in Canada and the United States.  Obviously in those first three markets the two-year swap rate has traded down, and at some points it fell below the target policy rate.  In a couple of cases, we’ve seen that the monetary authority made some policy adjustments.  So how should one think about that relationship, if at all, between the two-year swap rate and the policy rate, particularly in the cases where the swap rate has traded occasionally below the policy rate? MR. KOS.  That’s a great question.  The Committee spoke about the Canadian situation last time as something of an outlier, and one can see that here as well.  I think one way to view this is that the market probably does consider the prospects for the United States and Canada as somewhat better than for the euro area and the United Kingdom.  The case of Australia is a bit more interesting.  I don’t know to what degree technical factors are involved there.  The Australian economy has performed extremely well, and perhaps the markets are sniffing out a slowdown that’s not in the forecasts.  At least most forecasts that I’ve seen for Australia don’t show that its situation will become similar to that which the euro area and Japan are in now or toward which many people think the United Kingdom is heading.  So we might be getting an inkling here that perhaps the market is indeed looking for a better performance prospectively in the United States as they are for Canada. \n",

      "MR. STOCKTON.  We faced some rather considerable challenges in assembling this forecast—the largest one, of course, being to find a way to be helpful to you in setting monetary policy in a period when the probability of imminent military conflict with Iraq has become very high.  Early last fall, the Chairman commenced one of our pre-FOMC briefing sessions by asking whether the Greenbook forecast was ignoring the elephant in the room—the elephant being the potential for war.  We responded that we were well aware of that possibility.  But we believed that a forecast constructed to take explicit account of military conflict would focus attention on areas about which we knew very little and would distract us from providing you with our interpretation of incoming data and the underlying forces operating on the economy.  Still, we recognized then that, by incorporating developments in oil futures and financial markets, our forecast was, in effect, reflecting the evolving likelihood of military action in Iraq.  Well, in this forecast, the room has become very small and the elephant very large.  As you know, we opted for an approach that we think preserves maximum continuity with recent forecasts.  We have continued to take on board the path of oil prices implied by futures markets, current readings in financial markets, and recent measures of consumer sentiment.  These indicators, of course, embody a probability-weighted average of a wide range of possible outcomes, reflecting the collective judgment of market participants and survey respondents.  At this point, it seems safe to presume that they place a very substantial weight on an imminent war.  As events unfold in the coming days and weeks, readings on many variables conditioning our baseline forecast will shift, as outcomes currently embodied in that probability-weighted distribution become more or less likely.  Oil prices, equity values, and sentiment are almost certainly going to deviate—perhaps substantially—from the paths assumed in the forecast.  We attempted to give you a sense in the Greenbook of those factors on which we will be most focused and some rough quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of the forecast to movements in those variables.  At this point, you probably need little convincing that we don’t know what will happen in the weeks ahead with respect to conflict with Iraq or its economic consequences.  But, you may reasonably ask, what are the economic data and financial market developments of the past seven weeks telling us about the underlying condition of the U.S. economy as we head into this critical period?  If anyone’s hopes have risen momentarily that I will answer that question clearly, let me admit up front that I cannot.  A quick look at the top line of our forecast might suggest that we have learned a great deal about the economy and that what we’ve learned has been this year to about 2¼ percent at an annual rate, about ½ percentage point less than in our January forecast.  But in point of fact, owing to an upward revision to growth in the fourth quarter of last year, the level of real GDP is actually higher, on average, in the first half of this year than in our last forecast.  One of the key surprises in the incoming data was that inventories were not as lean in the fourth quarter of last year as we had thought.  Higher inventory investment accounts for all the 1¼ percentage point upward adjustment to the growth of real GDP last quarter; final sales were 11 of 101\f",
      "about unrevised.  With that stockbuilding already behind us, we see less upward impetus to activity from this source in the first half of this year.  Indeed, a smaller contribution from non-auto inventories more than accounts for the downward revision that we have made to our projection of activity in the first half of this year.  The recent data on spending, labor markets, and production have presented the usual mixed bag.  For the most part, the strength in spending that was apparent late last year carried into January.  To be sure, sales of new motor vehicles in January dropped off from the very high level observed in December, but other consumer outlays advanced at a rapid clip.  Housing activity—both sales and construction—jumped to very high levels, aided by good weather and very favorable financing conditions.  In the business sector, orders and shipments of capital goods in January exceeded our expectations, with spending for high-tech equipment posting an especially sharp rise.  But the picture in February and into March was not nearly so bright.  Motor vehicle sales posted another steep decline last month.  Snowstorms in the East evidently clobbered sales in late February, but reports for early March suggest that there has been only a modest bounceback so far.  Faced with sagging sales and mounting inventories, vehicle makers have announced significant cutbacks in production in the second quarter—a sign that they, too, are concerned about some underlying weakness in demand.  Retail sales apart from motor vehicles declined last month as well, and this morning’s housing starts release—which showed single-family starts off nearly 14 percent, to 1.3 million units in February—can be added to the list of downbeat indicators for that month.  Readings on the labor market and industrial activity also worsened in February and have shown little sign of improvement this month.  We were especially struck by the widespread weakness implied by last month’s labor market report.  Private payrolls contracted by 321,000 in February.  No doubt, bad weather contributed to the payrolls more broadly.  But try as we might, we could find no silver lining in that employment would be about flat early this year; instead, job losses have averaged about 100,000 over the past three months.  Industrial production is also coming in below our earlier expectations.  Declines late last year now look to be larger than previously estimated, and factory output is expected to eke out a much smaller gain this quarter than we had projected in January.  Although the declines in production witnessed last fall seem to have abated, there appears to be little upward momentum to manufacturing activity.  That view is supported by the available purchasing surveys, which have recently retraced earlier gains.  It is, of course, exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether this most recent softening in the data reflects underlying weakness in the economy or the intensifying effects of war-related fears and uncertainties.  Virtually all our major economic indicators at this point could be directly or indirectly influenced by actions or expectations related to the possibility of war.  Is consumer confidence low because of higher war-related energy prices or because the labor market is so soft?  Is the 12 of 101\f",
      "labor market soft because firms are hesitant to hire in advance of an imminent war or because product demand is weak?  I don’t know of any way to confidently break into that argument.  Moreover, I don’t think this is a signal extraction problem faced solely by the staff and other economic forecasters.  I seriously doubt that households and businesses can reliably disentangle underlying economic trends from effects related to possible military conflict.  Suffice it to say that, whatever the fundamental causes, the staff sees the economy on a somewhat shallower trajectory than we had earlier expected.  Moreover, a number of other factors led us to mark down a bit our projected growth of real GDP over the next year and a half.  For one, stock prices at the close of the Greenbook were about 10 percent below those anticipated in our previous forecast, and we lowered our projected path by a similar amount.  The effect of lower equity prices was only partly offset by the accompanying downward revision that we have made to long-term interest rates.  I should note, however, that the rise in equity to add back in much of the final demand we had taken out of the forecast.  Higher current and projected oil prices, especially over the next few quarters, are expected to take a larger bite out of household incomes than in the January projection.  Perhaps reflecting to some extent higher energy prices, consumer sentiment has weakened noticeably since the end of last year.  Consumers’ views of their own financial conditions, broader business conditions, buying conditions, and the labor market situation have all deteriorated noticeably in recent months.  Sentiment has dropped by more than can be explained by macroeconomic conditions, and in the forecast we expect this unusual weakness in household attitudes and their effect on consumption to fade only gradually over the next year and a half.  Not all of the key forces operating on the economy have been negative.  Fiscal policy, in particular, is providing more upward stimulus to activity than in our previous projection.  We have defense spending ramping up more sharply in this forecast compared with the last.  We have added about $20 billion to projected defense spending in both 2003 and 2004.  Separately, we have retained the package of tax cuts assumed in the January forecast, though we have delayed its projected implementation to the third quarter of this year.  Meanwhile, tax receipts have been coming in much lower than we had expected, largely reflecting another year of unexpectedly large refunds.  Smaller tax payments are providing a noticeable buffer against weaker labor income in this forecast and help to sustain the projected growth in consumer spending.  Despite the small net downward revision that we have made to the projection, we continue to expect a gradual acceleration of activity in the second half of this year and into 2004 for reasons that will sound quite familiar to you.  Stimulative monetary and fiscal policy contribute to the pickup, as does a gradual diminishment of the drag from earlier declines in the stock market.  Productivity growth shows no signs of flagging and should feed gains in both household incomes and corporate profits.  Finally, we expect the unusual restraint on household and business spending, which 13 of 101\f",
      "we are attributing in part to pessimism and uncertainty, to fade over the projection interval.  As has been the case for some time, this feature of the forecast must be considered more art than science.  Even as art, I’ll admit it’s closer to Jackson Pollock than to Rembrandt.  [Laughter]  With slack in resource utilization persisting throughout the forecast period, core inflation is expected to recede modestly in 2003 and 2004.  Indeed, core PCE price inflation drops to 1 percent in the second half of next year.  In working on this forecast, we—perhaps like many others in the economy—have felt as if we were biding our time, waiting for events to unfold and the situation to clarify itself.  But how much clarification of economic circumstances can be expected?  Certainly, a quick and successful resolution of the conflict with Iraq could be followed by a sharp decline in oil prices and a jump in equity values.  Household and business sentiment could improve swiftly and persistently.  With just a short lag, some high-frequency readings on the economy might provide evidence of follow-through to the real economy; initial claims, chain store sales, and reports from automakers would provide the early evidence on that score.  With luck, those readings would be confirmed by broader monthly measures of spending, production, and labor market conditions.  While it is less pleasant to contemplate, circumstances could clearly indicate a much less favorable outcome.  The use of weapons of mass destruction, substantial damage to the oil fields, or slow military progress could result in sizable adverse reactions in oil and financial markets and a further souring of sentiment.  The consequences of these developments could be reflected clearly in the flow of data on the real economy.  In either event, a significant narrowing of uncertainties would allow us to get a much better fix on macroeconomic conditions and provide you with clearer direction on the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  But a third possibility seems eminently plausible—namely, that there will not be in the months immediately ahead a dramatic shrinkage in the uncertainty surrounding underlying economic conditions.  There are a number of reasons for suspecting that this might be the case.  Under the best of circumstances, financial markets will be volatile, and the data on the economy will be both noisy and often available with only a frustrating lag.  It could take months to detect the economic consequences of the events that will unfold in the period ahead.  Moreover, the best of circumstances may not present themselves.  Even if the military situation concludes as quickly and successfully as it did in 1991, broader geopolitical risks may linger in a way that they did not after the earlier Gulf War.  The threat of terrorist responses may not decline and could conceivably increase even in the wake of a successful military campaign.  As a consequence, the current hesitance to spend and hire may not diminish rapidly.  Moreover, there have been additional sources of geopolitical tension in recent months—North Korea and Iran, to name just two.  We will need to be watchful of euphoric reactions in financial markets and among households and businesses.  Those initial readings may signal a more vigorous rebound from recent doldrums, but that enthusiasm could prove unjustified over time by the underlying fundamentals.  If so, the favorable initial reaction signaled by asset prices and sentiment would fade.   14 of 101\f",
      "Finally, there could be a real economic bounce following the successful conclusion of a war.  Some firms might act on spending and hiring plans that were delayed by war fears.  Households, too, may boost spending that had been deferred by worries about war and the accompanying high levels of prices for gasoline and heating fuel.  Witnessing such a rebound, however, will provide no assurance that the economy is moving onto a more persistently vigorous growth path.  If the underlying health of the economy remains lackluster, a temporary period of above-trend growth could give way, yet again, to subpar performance.  In effect, circumstances might be similar to a year ago.  As the worst case scenarios following the attacks of September 11 failed to materialize, we saw a rapid acceleration of activity that could not be sustained by the underlying condition of the economy.  I don’t want to exaggerate in either direction here.  Clearly, we’re likely to know a great deal more than we do now should a swift and successful military action be completed in the period ahead.  But I suspect that, even in those circumstances, you will see only a partial lifting of the fog of uncertainty that currently shrouds the economic outlook.

      "MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What we hear repeatedly around the District are phrases such as “muddling along,” “on hold,” and “wait and see.”  Bank loan demand is flat.  It’s very difficult to know—I don’t think anybody can tell—how much of what we’ve been observing is a consequence of war fears and how much of it reflects underlying uncertainties.  I’ve been pressing my contacts about their capital spending plans and in particular trying to find out if people are thinking ahead to the expiration of the tax incentives in September of next year.  In general, people comment that they are not taking that into account yet, and capital spending is flat.  My UPS contact says that UPS capital expenditures are for repairing or replacing equipment as necessary but there is no growth in the company’s capital expenditures spending.  However, my FedEx contact said that FedEx does plan to buy trucks very aggressively to take advantage of the investment incentives.  He expects that perhaps 5 to10 percent of FedEx capital outlays in 2004 will reflect spending being moved from 2005 into 2004 to take advantage of those incentives. I believe there is a way to think about the national picture that may be useful.  Think back, for example, to the middle of last week when the Greenbook was being put to bed, which was before the Thursday stock market rally.  Let me put this in a very overstated, extreme way in order to make a point.  If we view a lot of the data as reflecting the means of a fairly wide distribution, then maybe there’s a 50 percent probability of a really good outcome—call that a 10—and a 50 percent probability of a very weak outcome, flat or something like that.  Call that weak outcome a zero.  The mean is 5, but in fact there’s not much probability weight on 5 as the actual outcome; it’s spread out at these extremes, and that is a very unusual situation.  Now, what we’ve seen just in the last few days is a quite substantial surge in equity prices, a drop in the price of oil, and a big increase in the value of the dollar—a large one-day move yesterday that is 40 of 101\f",
      "very atypical.  Those developments may well indicate that people are now putting more weight on the outcome we called 10 and less weight on the outcome we called zero.  If this way of thinking about the situation is useful, it means—given that in coming weeks we will know more about whether the outcome is likely to be closer to the 10 or the zero—that perhaps the best course for us at this point is not to try to guess.  If we guess wrong, the action we took based on that guess will not have been very appropriate.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, growth in economic activity in the Third District has faltered.  At least part of this is due to uncertainty over the timing, duration, and magnitude of the war, as many others have said.  It’s likely that when this uncertainty is resolved we’ll see stronger growth, but our survey evidence suggests that economic activity might not necessarily rebound quickly after military action in Iraq.  Manufacturing in our area has turned down over the last two months.  The general activity index of our business outlook survey fell from 2.3 in February to minus 8 in our March survey to be released on Thursday.  That is the lowest reading since December 2001.  New orders also A special question in our February survey provides some evidence on how soon economic activity might rebound after geopolitical uncertainty is resolved.  We asked our survey respondents to tell us whether their hiring and spending plans this year were adversely affected by geopolitical uncertainty, weak demand, or something else.  Respondents could choose more than one factor.  About 40 percent of respondents said that geopolitical uncertainties were affecting their hiring and spending plans this year, but nearly 60 percent said that lack of demand was having an effect.  Of course, the cause of the lack of demand may well be geopolitical risks.  It’s difficult to separate the two.  Nonetheless, this seems to indicate concerns about the state of the economy that may go beyond the effects of the current Gulf conflict.  Firms in our survey did not appear to be poised to resume spending upon the resolution of geopolitical uncertainty.  Only 10 percent plan to begin hiring and 8 percent plan to resume investment as soon as uncertainty is resolved.  But over 40 percent plan to wait at least six months or have no plans to increase hiring or capital spending upon resolution of uncertainty.  Responses to the special question indicate that, relative to their plans at the start of the year, about a third of the firms have delayed adding 43 of 101\f",

      "MR. KOHN. You folks in Chicago wouldn’t even have noticed it if you had had this storm!  Seasonally adjusted, it’s always spring in Chicago.  Very nasty weather along the East Coast had a major effect on the data for employment, production, and sales in February.  The rise in energy prices since late last year, reflected in gasoline and home heating expenses, undoubtedly sapped consumer spending directly.  Moreover, the higher gasoline prices and uncertainty about future gasoline prices may have played a role in weakening auto sales, especially if that uncertainty caused people to postpone decisions.   Governor Bernanke noted at the last meeting that, the closer the event with uncertain outcomes, the higher the hurdle rate for investment.  It’s not surprising that many different kinds of business commitments—hiring as well as spending on capital goods—were pushed back.  It strikes me that today’s housing data may suggest that decisions on home purchases and housing investment could be affected as well by the heightened uncertainty.  Certainly this uncertainty is reflected in equity markets, where the equity premium—a key element in what is in effect a hurdle rate for buying the existing capital stock—has risen sharply.  Undoubtedly as uncertainties abate, the markets will improve—as we’ve already seen in the last few days—and this improvement will allow stronger fundamentals to show through.   Nonetheless, we don’t know how strong the fundamentals are.  We can’t completely dismiss the possibility that the February data were also signaling a less robust strengthening in demand than we had anticipated.  That’s certainly the way the credit markets seemed to interpret the new information, especially the February employment report.  Interest rates were marked down across the yield curve, with declines in forward rates in the five-to-seven-year range accounting for the largest decreases.  A portion of the earlier drop in equity prices seemed to 52 of 101\f",
      "reflect not only higher equity premiums but downward revisions to earnings and revenue forecasts, which were probably only tangentially related to war fears.   At this point, however, it is simply not possible to sort out the relative strength of the various influences on the economy or financial markets.  The staff based its forecast on the current structure of prices and rates and financial markets because it was the only sensible default mode.  The lower equity prices, in particular, played a role in weakening the forecast a touch.  But those prices and rates, as Dave pointed out, reflect the means of some very skewed and strangely dispersed distributions.  All we know for sure is that, as the situation unfolds and various outcomes get more or less probability weight, those prices and rates will change—and possibly by quite a lot as we’ve seen in the last few days.  Moreover, a good part of that unfolding will occur relatively soon, and a reasonable presumption is that the forecast will change too, perhaps significantly.   Personally, I suspect that our next action is more likely to be an easing than a tightening.  I base that on the possibility that at least a little of the February weakness reflected continued underlying softness and broader business uncertainty and on the possibility that geopolitical risk could continue to weigh on oil prices, sentiment, and spending for a while.  I combine these possibilities, however small, with the notion that at this stage of the economic cycle—with a sizable output gap and low and declining inflation—the consequences from inadvertently having policy a little too tight would be far more adverse than the consequences from having it a little too easy.  But I don’t have any real conviction about the next policy action.  We’ll have more information about unfolding events and their potential effects soon.  Over the near term, much of that information will come from reactions in financial and oil markets, as underlying trends in spending will only slowly reveal themselves.  These markets will be noisy.

      "MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Fourth District appear to be broadly consistent with those in the rest of the nation.  Two sentences in the Beige Book national summary describe our situation very well—namely that growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February and that geopolitical and economic uncertainties are constraining business and consumer spending and tempering near-term expectations.  I think the staff did an excellent job in reporting, analyzing, and synthesizing the data that have come in since our last meeting.  The staff concluded that the economy is likely to be weaker in the near term, yet real GDP growth and inflation next year are expected to be about the same as was forecast at our last meeting, indicating the largely transient nature of the additional softness.  I generally agree with that forecast, although how I arrive at the GDP figures is slightly different.  I’d like to focus my comments this morning on some of this near-term weakness and its potential implications.  First, the March 7 release of the February labor market data does seem to have powerfully affected market sentiment about the economy.  All of us are aware that last month’s weather distorted economic activity, and our Beige Book contacts across a wide range of retail sectors reported that the winter storms did affect their sales.  Even if we knew how to account for the weather, we probably still would conclude that labor markets weakened in with one month’s data.   One of my directors, whose firm supplies materials nationally to the homebuilding orders had declined in February, they bounced back in early March.  Overall I don’t get a sense from our directors or advisory council members and other contacts in the District that conditions 59 of 101\f",

The economy is still expanding, and it is expected to do so, albeit at a very moderate pace.  Housing has continued to be strong, and the bankers in my District say that it’s going to continue to be strong.  Business investment is weak, and it is expected to remain weak according to business people in my District.  I’ve had many conversations with contacts throughout the District about how credit availability, the geopolitical risks, and capacity utilization are affecting the pace of their capital spending.  Bankers report that they are very liquid and anxious to lend.  In fact, they note in a more short-term perspective that they finally have started to receive inquiries from their business customers.  Customers have increased their credit lines but are not using those lines, which tells me at least that they’re gearing up for some use of them down the road but not until the Iraq situation is resolved.  Within the last week alone, two of my business contacts informed me that their firms had turned away sizable orders because to fill those orders they would have to add to capacity and, with the uncertainty that we face, they weren’t willing to do that.  In ordinary times, those investments would have been made. So, as I commented at the last meeting, I still am concerned about the outlook for a snapback in BFI given the current low levels of capacity utilization.  Our research department did some statistical work to examine the relationship between capacity utilization and business fixed investment.  We found that both the level and the change in capacity utilization strongly lead business investment, again suggesting that we shouldn’t expect a pickup in BFI until some of the excess capacity gets absorbed.  From our Beige Book contacts we hear a consistent story, namely that they are not willing to add to their capacity.  Many of them still have a lot of idle capacity and aren’t planning any additional capital spending even to bring that idle capacity back 60 of 101\f",
      "on line.  This does not mean that we won’t see any spending on plant and equipment or software but rather that the upward trajectory is not going to be as steep as we’d like to see.  Interestingly, I think the caution about capital spending fits into the Greenbook projection of strong productivity growth.  I say that because the CEOs I talk to are telling me that, even though they are paying very close attention to payrolls and to capital spending—they’re not hiring and they’re not spending—they are still innovating.  These efforts show up in the healthy rate of multifactor productivity growth as we see in the Greenbook. In summary, I am discouraged by the lack of progress in the expansion thus far, but I believe that some of it is clearly due to the unsettled risks of war and terrorism.  Obviously, the potential for war is a very dark cloud overhead—and not that far overhead perhaps.  Although this cloud is restraining economic activity now, I do believe that its successful dissolution will result in a continued economic expansion.  So as the Vice Chair and others have indicated today, this is a time for the central bank to be patient, to watch developments unfold, and especially to see how the economy looks once this dark cloud of uncertainty dissipates.

We have to be very careful, if we’re looking at new techniques, not to get ourselves involved in any pegging of intermediate- or longer-term rates.  I say that not because we couldn’t make it happen but because the problem of unwinding that sort of peg will result in utter chaos.  We have no choice but to fix the overnight rate because we’ve tried everything else and nothing else has worked.  Pegging the overnight rate is a fallback position and one that I’m sure we would endeavor to work our way out of if we could.  If we decide that we want to move to the intermediate rates to try to support rates, the last thing we want to do is to mention what our goal is because we will never be able to unwind from that if we get locked in to a specific pattern.  I agree with Governor Gramlich that it’s certainly not too soon to give some thought to these issues.  But we have to be careful in determining not only how we phase our way into a particular policy but how we phase our way out.  In many respects, the latter is far more difficult than the former. \n",

I also would have been comfortable if you had recommended a slight cut in rates and that had been possible given the market situation.  I agree, too, that the risk–reward tradeoff is tilted in such a way that I would rather be a little too easy rather than a little too tight, so I’d take my chances on that side.  But in that regard I think we do get a lot of benefit from this statement by breaking up the balance of risks.  I might note that I don’t think Roger did quite as bad a job in constructing the old balance of risk statement as he averred in his statement.  To me it didn’t quite have the tradeoff in it that you said it did.  But the fact that you thought it did and that others were confused by it suggests that it is certainly inadequate to the current situation.  So I consider it very helpful to unbundle the risks.  I think highlighting the downside risks on inflation will be very beneficial by letting the world know what we are worried about.  It reinforces the last paragraph of your testimony and puts that issue on the table more forcefully.  I think that will help to influence expectations and to give long-term rates scope to move down if activity doesn’t pick up very much and if inflation comes in lower.  And I believe that’s very helpful. As to the adding up of apples and pears, I think that’s basically what we have to do here at the end of the day.  We have to weigh these different factors and add them up.  By the way, I like the apples and pears better than the sausage that I used to hear we made around this table.

Not only are financial markets fragile, but they can also be fickle.  We don’t want to do anything that will set them off unnecessarily.  I think Bill’s and Don’s argument is right that this statement conveys much the same sentiment as a funds rate cut.  But it’s still different from taking an easing action because people in the market know that we’re going to be reading the incoming information on the economy, as are they.  So I feel more comfortable deferring any action until June depending on the nature of the incoming information.  \n",

That’s an easy answer to give after the fact, and I hope we conveyed in the paper the thought that as we witnessed that period in real time we, too, did not perceive that Japan was sliding into the difficult situation that subsequently developed.  So, that’s meant to be a red flag.  But it’s also meant not to trivialize the problem of our inability to see the future with any great clarity.   Relative to the kinds of options that these gentlemen have put on the table today, I think there would be a lot of agreement that there was one thing the Bank of Japan did that was very wrong.  Namely, at each step along the way they portrayed the situation as abnormal and an emergency, and they indicated that the actions they were taking made them uncomfortable and that it was their intent to return to more-normal operations absolutely as soon as possible.  That certainly characterized their first steps in the direction of zero interest rates, and I think they’ve probably learned from that mistake.  One doesn’t hear Japanese officials use that kind of language any longer.  But in the earlier stages there was always a tone that they grudgingly were going to do a little more if they had to and were going to take it back just as soon as they could.  Admittedly, some of the things that made them uncomfortable are the very problems that have been identified here.  And those are real problems.

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, we have a whole set of tools that in principle could be used and should address this issue effectively.  We know in the abstract which combinations of tools would be the best and how they would interact with the economy in a way that we would consider satisfactory.  I don’t think we can know in advance, however, which combination of tools we actually would use, and I think it’s foolish to even suppose that we can.  But to go through an abstract analysis can be a very useful exercise.  For example, I thought the analysis in the supplemental papers on the various potential effects of moving the funds rate down was instructive. Incidentally, as for those potential effects, the only one I disagree with is the notion that, if the money market mutual funds start to dissolve and we get a switch from mutual fund holdings to deposits in the commercial banking system, bank capital ratios will become a problem.  Such a switch would indeed build up both the liability and the asset sides of the balance sheet, so statistically it is obviously the case that the capital ratios would become an issue, but economically that can’t be.  Here we have two types of institutions that are financial intermediaries—money market mutual funds with assets and liabilities and little capital and a commercial banking system.  If the money market mutual funds are squeezed out of business, effectively what you’re arguing is that those two sets of institutions are consolidated in a sense—to the extent, for example, that those who are borrowing in the commercial paper market will be back in the bank market.  The whole notion of merely consolidating the two sets of institutions and then finding that there must be a problem, if there wasn’t one before, may make statistical sense, but it doesn’t make economic sense.  What that situation would suggest to me, if indeed we get a very major escalation in bank deposits, is that the problem that may arise relates to what we should do with bank capital ratios 25 of 211\f",
      "because we’re dealing with a huge industry.  Yet if all that occurs, which is what one would think will occur, the asset side of the banking system will be loaded up with short-term Treasury bills and other such assets or even commercial paper.  In that situation, we might be inclined to think that we’re seeing capital deficiencies in the banking system and that we have a crisis.  That can’t make any sense.  That’s shooting ourselves in the foot.  So if you’re asking for a specific recommendation regarding what we should do under those conditions, the answer is this:  We ought to re-examine our process of determining capital adequacy in the context of consolidating the two types of financial institutions, with the full recognition that there cannot be increased financial risk on the basis of whether two intermediaries are acting by themselves or as a consolidated institution.  Yet that’s what we would have statistically.  President Minehan. \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with a confession.  I’m an outlier.  I know this is true in many respects, [laughter] but I’m referring to my forecast for growth next year, which is above the Committee’s central tendency and close to that of the staff.  I base this bit of exuberance, which I believe to be rational, on the following factors.  First, we’ve seen tentative and preliminary signs over the intermeeting period that the economy is indeed beginning to strengthen.  It appears to be responding to the gradual waning of the hangover in financial markets and the real economy from the excesses of the late 1990s and to the moderation of geopolitical risks that have been associated with the war in Iraq.  Retail sales and industrial production picked up in May.  Labor markets have stabilized.  Capital goods orders and shipments, while no great shakes, are still at least consistent with a rebound from the exceptionally weak first quarter.  And purchasing managers’ surveys have turned up.  These signs, including the May orders data, for the most part reflect actual transactions and decisions taken before the May meeting and its consequences.   Second, there’s now a lot more stimulus coming than we had thought at the time of the number of people have discussed, and some of it is our own doing.  The perception that monetary policy will be easier for longer has helped to lower interest rates, increase equity prices, and depreciate the dollar, all without raising inflation expectations.  Easier financial conditions are not just occurring in the United States.  Equity markets are up, and long-term rates are down all over the globe, though other countries obviously are getting the other side of dollar depreciation.  This improvement clearly reflects developments in the United States, but it also probably builds on a perception—reinforced by a significant easing by the ECB over the intermeeting period—that monetary policy abroad will be easier for longer. 114 of 211\f",
      "Third, although outcomes like my forecast or the Greenbook’s seem pretty ebullient, in fact they assume that the restraint on business spending lifts slowly and that the economy does not exhibit all that much resilience.  These forecasts do not assume that the economy exhibits a reversion to mean behavior once the huge amount of stimulus being applied is taken into account.  In effect, the equilibrium real interest rate, although rising a bit over the forecast period, remains unusually low and well below what one might think of as the long-term natural rate, especially taking account of the assumed rise in productivity.  In that regard the forecast is somewhat conservative. Still, until we see an actual and appreciable strengthening of growth, I consider the risks around such a forecast to be weighted decidedly toward the downside.  In fact, the economy has not rebounded sharply from pre-war weakness.  Growth in the second quarter is a little slower in this country than anticipated and much weaker abroad.  Such downside risk is reinforced for me by the fact that I really don’t understand entirely what is holding the economy back.  Perhaps, as we’ve speculated, the slow business spending results from a lack of confidence after the real and financial turmoil of the boom-and-bust period.  That caution no doubt has been accentuated by concerns about risk-taking by CEOs and boards, given the severity of potential legal and market punishments for getting it wrong.  These restraints should erode under pressure from rising sales and favorable financing terms as they do slowly in the staff forecast.  But they haven’t eroded yet.  They could persist and be even stronger than in the Greenbook if businesses continue not to see much in the way of profitable opportunities for investment.  Businesses already are realizing huge gains in efficiency by utilizing existing capital much better; rapid productivity growth is boosting profits and income and economic potential, but it’s not increasing the incentives to invest, at least so far.  The net is that, in marked contrast with the late 1990s, sizable and 115 of 211\f",
      "continuing monetary and fiscal stimulus has been required to have even the hope of eating into underutilized margins of resources.  We can’t be sure this configuration will improve until we begin to see convincing evidence of a marked firming in business spending.  Until then I think we also can’t rule out the possibility that we may need to reduce interest rates substantially further and hold them there for a time.   Intermeeting developments have helped to alleviate some of my concerns about the pace of disinflation.  The rise in core consumer prices in May along with the drop in the dollar and elevated energy prices suggest to me a lower risk that inflation expectations will decrease substantially in the near term.  Stronger demand should limit the longer-term disinflationary trend.  Still, inflation is declining at a time when it is already near the low end of a range that’s probably consistent with nominal interest rates that allow us sufficient flexibility to respond to added downward shocks.  If inflation expectations are falling along with inflation, real funds rates may actually be edging higher.  Moreover, the improvement in financial conditions after the last meeting was built on the expectation that, if the economy remained soft and inflation threatened to go substantially lower, we would respond—not only by keeping rates low but by reducing them further.  My forecast, like that of the staff, assumes that the easier financial conditions of the past few weeks will persist.  With strengthening demand still a forecast rather than an actuality and inflation still moving down, it seems to me that the economy needs the extra stimulus from highly accommodative policy and the more stimulative financial conditions.  And we need to find ways in the policy portion of our meeting to preserve the financial gains of the intermeeting period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. OLSON.  I’d like to re-emphasize a couple of data points, especially some mentioned earlier in the chart show.  The first involves the new tax law.  You may remember that Steve Oliner pointed out some provisions of the law that the staff had anticipated and some that were unanticipated.  I would remind you that all of the provisions were crammed into a tax bill that met the Senate’s budget constraints.  To do that required an artful amount of posturing in order to bring a lot of stimulus into a very short period of time.  One of the wags writing about the tax package suggested that it has so many sunrises and sunsets that it could be called the “Fiddler on the Roof tax bill.”  [Laughter]  My point is that very heavy bets have been made that this tax package will be stimulative in the third quarter, which starts next Tuesday.  I have to say that, whatever else may or may not happen, the tax changes will provide a significant amount of additional discretionary spending capability starting right away.  Additional incentives for business fixed investment begin at that time also.   The second point I would mention is the coupon gap.  We moved over this issue fairly quickly, but because of the increase in the coupon gap that occurred just recently this month, that rate gap is now at a decade-high level.  There is still a tremendous amount of capacity for refinancing and an enormous amount of home equity available to be tapped.  So unless mortgage holders have finally reached the point at which they are no longer responding to those low rates, we will continue to see refinancings.  As a result, one of two things is going to happen.  People will have more spending power either from the cash taken out or from reduced mortgage payments, which will increase their discretionary spending capabilities.  So I am optimistic about the prospects for the third and fourth quarters and the possibility that the second half of the year will be as positive as in the staff forecast.  That said, the data to this point certainly do not indicate that there has been a turnaround, so it does seem to me an appropriate time for easing.   117 of 211\f",
      "I would like to make one more point, just to follow up briefly on a comment that I made yesterday regarding the effect of lower interest rates on the banking industry.  As I noted, the banking industry in the first quarter had record profits in spite of the fact that banks had a significant reduction in their interest rate margin.  But that was only because the provision for chargeoffs was reduced significantly—and appropriately so, given the improved credit quality of their loan portfolios.  The coverage of loan-loss reserves is appropriate by any measure of delinquency or chargeoffs on accrual loans.  However, another contributor to the profit picture was the realized gains on securities, which were as high as they have been for the past ten years.  So we’re starting to see managers in the banking industry make some strategic decisions based on a new interest rate environment.  What this suggests to me is that increasingly we’re going to be hearing from a number of sectors about the impact of low interest rates on their business.  I think all of us are going to have an opportunity in the next few weeks to remind people that we set monetary policy not aimed at advantaging one sector or another but on the basis of its likely effect on the overall economy.   \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support both parts of your recommendation.  I do think we need to follow our talk with action.  As for the size, 25 versus 50 basis points, I recognize as President Parry said that one could make a case for 50 on the grounds of being aggressive and getting ahead of the problem.  But I think 25 is appropriately sized for the situation, given that we do see signs of some improvement and there’s a lot of stimulus in the pipeline.  I believe that the 25 basis point cut taken together with a sense of downside risk to inflation should limit any upward ratcheting of interest rates from what little disappointment there will be in the market.  Like President Poole, I presume that if we don’t get the rebound that we’re looking for in the third quarter, we’re going to have another serious conversation in Let me make a couple more comments on some of the things that have been said.  I do have a little concern about the sense that we might shy away from a rate cut that we think is needed because of the signal that such a move would send to the markets.  If I thought 50 basis points were the appropriate action, I would argue in favor of that, and I would have confidence in our ability to explain it, though it would be very difficult to shape our message so that we weren’t sending the wrong signal.  I would worry if I thought that concern about the message being sent kept us from doing the right thing.  In my view it’s the combination of our words and actions that will shape market expectations and confidence.  I think we can put the two together in a way that we get out the message we want to send.   Let me touch on a few more things that were mentioned.  The word “sustainable” in my mind is growth at potential.  The way I see the three sentences in the balance of risks statement is that the first sentence is about the output gap, the second sentence is about the inflation gap, and the third sentence adds it up.  So if I think the first sentence is about the output gap, sustainable 148 of 211\f",
      "to me means growth at potential.  Interestingly, relative to what Governor Bernanke said earlier today, the forecasts that we’ll be putting out are for growth above potential and are not entirely consistent with the statement that we’re likely to put out.  How we’re going to handle the balance of risks language may be more of a problem going forward if growth actually does pick up.  I don’t think it’s a problem for today.   Finally, Vincent’s chart in the top left-hand panel of chart 1 brought home to me that actually it wasn’t so much the release of the words in our press statement that resulted in the change in financial conditions; it was all the things that followed, including our own statements. It involved the interaction of what we said later and the data that came out relative to what we had said earlier.  Many of us, myself included, were a little surprised by the reactions to some of the things we said.  To the extent that some of us have expressed concern that there’s too much talk of deflation—that people don’t understand that it’s disinflation we’re talking about—I think we all, present speaker included, need to be very cautious about what we say.  We need to be careful that we’re not confusing the situation and fanning concerns that are not appropriate.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the way that Roger Ferguson phrased the issue—that the threshold of evidence provided by the data since our last meeting was not sufficient for us not to change rates today.  So I do agree with the 25 basis point cut and the way you phrased the balance of risks.  But of course the data we talk about are always looking backward, and the key is the forecast going forward.  As we’ve often said in these meetings, sometimes the last cut or the last increase in the funds rate target is the one that’s not needed because we didn’t have perfect information at the time we made that cut or increase.  I certainly hope that’s true this time, and I hope we won’t have to move forward with any nontraditional forms of monetary policy. I do want to say a word about the risks statement, though.  In my view Vincent has done an admirable job in trying to take the wording of our statement from the last meeting and to put it into this old framework that we had for the balance of risks.  On an interim basis, I think that’s fine.  But I believe—and I’m going to sound like a broken record here because I recommended this at the last meeting—that a subcommittee of this Committee should be appointed to look at this in more detail, as was done in past.  The most recent such subcommittee was the one that Roger chaired, and there were several presidents and several members of the Board on it.  This is a very tricky area.  A couple of points have been mentioned here today.  Governor Bies has concerns about the phrase “downside risks” with regard to inflation, and Bob Parry is worried about the word “sustainable.”  Don Kohn made a very good point that down the road, when we’re looking for sustainable economic growth, we may not want to say that the risk is weighted toward the upside.  So I think a group of us should look at this in more detail and come back with a recommendation to this Committee regarding how to deal with this on a longer-term basis. 153 of 211\n",

You mentioned that the downward trend in ten-year yields had a lot to do with our move of only 25 basis points and the discussion of deflation in our statement.  But ten-year yields and mortgage rates had been coming down for some time.  The big mortgage lenders had to have been wrong in their hedging activities.  Does anybody have any sense, independent of our comments about deflation and so forth, what the bounceback in yields might have been solely as a result of the improvement in the economic data?  I recognize that it’s very hard to say. MR. KOS.  I would agree with your opening statement that it’s impossible to answer that with any precision.  It’s very hard to assign percentages to the causes.  In my own mind, the dynamics in the mortgage market clearly were a very important factor.

I’ve heard discussions in the technology arena about long supply lines, very low inventories, and the possibility that when demand begins to accelerate—people in the industry say “if”—there will be the potential for a strong reaction to that demand so that it can be supplied.  An offset to that, and one that I worry about a little, is the increasing proportion of foreign goods that are used in our overall capital investment process.  I’m not sure how much that would offset the pickup from an inventory swing.  With regard to the communication process, I don’t think we should change anything about the last statement as you have recommended.

I’m probably the only one here who is not particularly looking forward to the September discussion [laughter] because I’m not sure I see my way through it.  I guess I should confess that it’s partly because my wife has been telling me for forty years now that I don’t communicate particularly well.  [Laughter]  So I have that adverse mental association with the whole concept.   I just find this a very hard issue to address.  First, on the statement itself I have expressed my reservations before about adding up or balancing the output risk and the inflation risk.  I’ve always had that problem.  Second, I think the phrase “the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation” may have served us well a couple of months ago, but as the probability of this substantial fall gets more and more minor, that sentence is going to have to be changed.  And I’m not sure how to do that.  The third problem is that any time we change anything in this paragraph, even a comma, there is a huge market reaction.  The way the market reacts even to minor inflections of what we say scares me.  So I think that’s a real problem in trying to communicate and be honest about what we think. Along with many of you, I share the reluctance to pre-commit to a future policy course.  However, I’m on the side of Governors Bernanke and Kohn in feeling that we probably do have to get into this issue a little in terms of explaining our assessment of the outlook.  At some point, the way we do it now is not going to work—and maybe that point has come already—but I just don’t know how best to change our approach.  This whole process takes place in a fishbowl.

      "MR. BERNANKE.  I also agree with you on that, Bill.  The technical distinction you’re making, as you mentioned in your remarks, relates to the idea that the economy is in a rational expectations equilibrium where everyone has the same information.  In that case, anything the Fed says is going to be redundant.  On the other hand, as the Chairman said, it would be harmless as well.   There are several reasons that we might not be in a rational expectations equilibrium.  One is that the outside world doesn’t have all the information we have.  They may not have information about our objectives.  They may not have information about our views on the economy, which may be relevant even if they’re wrong.  For those reasons, what we say might be instructive to the public.  In particular, conditional information that we provide, which essentially gives insight into our rule, would be useful to the outside world. I might add a further thought here.  I attended a very interesting conference at Jack Guynn’s Atlanta Fed in March about learning, which is a big area of research in macroeconomics these days.  It looks at the way in which an economy gets to a rational expectations equilibrium.  As you probably know, one of the most studied questions in that field is whether or not people, using all the information they have but without being given information by the central bank, can learn—with, say, least squares or other methodologies—the rational expectations equilibrium.  What we often find in those models is that even very sophisticated players will end up in suboptimal equilibriums—failure of equilibrium to exist, multiple equilibriums.  The notion is that because people do not know the true rule, they will behave in a very volatile way, which will induce volatile behavior on the part of the central bank, which in turn will make it very difficult to learn and so on.  25 of 78\f",
      "The point is that there are a number of reasons to think that the Fed has useful information.  I’m actually quite in agreement that we shouldn’t be giving unconditional information about our interest rate setting.  We should be trying to guide the market by providing conditional forecasts about which direction our policy will be going in light of our objectives, our views, or the nature of our rule. \n",

      "MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I would approach this a little differently.  I found Vincent’s memo very useful in organizing my thinking about this.  So, I’d start with his five principles, and I would add a sixth, which is that in communicating with the markets about policy and expectations it’s important not to put too big a burden on the statement—or try to do things with the statement that are not feasible.  I think we might have tried to do that a bit in this period, and I believe that might have been part of the problem.  One can argue that point, I suppose.  In particular, I personally feel that it’s important to resist any temptation to use the statement to try to engineer expectations in the marketplace about what’s going to happen to policy settings or to the funds rate at some point in the future.  I don’t think we can do that consistently.  Even if we’re not trying to do it, I believe we need to do what we can to avoid giving the impression that we might be doing that.   Let me emphasize that in saying this I am not arguing for reduced transparency but for being transparent about the things that really matter and about which we can be confident.  With that in mind, it seems to me that the place to start in reducing the burden on the statement is to be more explicit and clearer about our inflation objectives.  For example, we could announce our intention to hold core PCE inflation in a 1 to 2 percent target range while continuing to take account—as we do today—of both inflation and real output.  I recognize that the proposal to introduce inflation targets has been controversial in this Committee.  But in view of some of the problems we’ve had with communications lately, it seems to me that there’s an argument for taking another look at that approach.  If we tied inflation expectations down firmly with a target range, then markets could routinely and continuously make informed judgments about how sentiment in this Committee—whether inflation is a concern or deflation is a problem—is evolving over time.  Market players could assess that by just looking at the behavior of actual 32 of 78\f",
      "inflation in relation to the target range.  We might need to add something to our policy statement about how we intend to get inflation back in the neighborhood of the target range if at some point it moves away from the range.  But we would not need to rely on ad hoc additions to or deletions from the statement that run the risk of being ignored or amplified or generally misunderstood in the markets. What that means to me is that we could have a statement that is more formulaic in character, along the lines of what Bob Parry was just saying, which I personally think would be a good thing.  Also, just as an aside here, your suggestion for making the statement the basis of what we vote on is a good one.   Among the five alternative models you’ve shown here, Vincent, I suppose my approach would be closest to the Bank of England model.  Obviously, clarifying the inflation objectives and expediting the minutes would take the pressure off the statement, which could then be reduced to its essentials.  But it would put a burden on the preparation of the minutes.  Norm and Carol are good friends, and I don’t want to lose their friendship.  So I would hasten to add that if we were to go in this direction, we would have to augment our resources for preparing the minutes to whatever extent necessary to make that a feasible and manageable process.  I think the additional burden in that area would be justified by relieving us of the need to use the statement to send detailed—and at times potentially complicated or confusing—messages to the it could observe in the context of a very clearly stated objective that we have announced. \n",

      "MR. BROADDUS.  Can we get that in the minutes?  [Laughter]  Could I just make one response to that, Mr. Chairman?  I certainly hear your comments, and I must say that I don’t think that explicit inflation targeting is a silver bullet or that it’s going to solve all the problems we face.  But in the context of this discussion, I would like to use an example—and maybe I’m violating the admonition not to get too close to the current situation.  Suppose we currently had a range of 1 to 2 percent for the core PCE.  We are now at the lower bound and may be pushing a bit below it.  Again, having an announced target wouldn’t solve all the world’s problems, but I think it would add something important—namely, that the markets and the public should have a very clear understanding that the risk in the outlook with respect to inflation is on the downside.  They would know that it clearly would be a conditioning factor in some way in our policies going forward.  It would eliminate any need for us to feel that we must elaborate our statement in an ad hoc way—I don’t know that we’re necessarily doing this now—at some point down the road.  I would be very concerned about the longer-run type of steady-state communication relationship between the markets and the Fed that such an approach might create. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  A point that I don’t think has come up yet is the fact that we’re talking to a number of different audiences.  With regard to our political accountability—talking to the Congress and the general public—I think we do just fine, and I believe the current publication schedule for the minutes fully serves that audience.  In terms of talking to the markets, Cathy and Jamie mentioned the traders, and I’d certainly like to draw a distinction between the traders and the portfolio managers.  The traders make their money from reading tea leaves, hot tips, and understanding little nuances.  What they really want to know is what our thinking is about the federal funds rate at the next meeting or the possibility of intermeeting changes in the rate.  They don’t very much care about why or the underlying reasons.  To speak to the point that Gary talked about, moving up the release of the minutes, I think the argument against that is that we’d really be speaking to the traders who are trying to divine what we are going to do at the next meeting.  They care about the policy action rather than about the underlying rationale for the policy.  So actually I think there’s a real advantage in specific meeting to which they apply.  That allows the minutes to be interpreted by those who care about trying to understand the reasons for the underlying policy and not just the action we took at that particular meeting and a forecast of the action we’re going to take next. \n",

      "MR. STOCKTON.  What we’ve seen, obviously, is a very significant jump in disposable income that, as one would expect, was not matched fully by an increase in consumer spending of the same magnitude in July.  But just because the amount spent of that increased disposable income was 50 percent or a bit more, I don’t think we’d say that it is a measure of the marginal propensity to consume out of those tax cuts.  As you know, Mr. Chairman, in the research on the 2001 tax cut and even the tax change in 1990-91, there is still some academic controversy regarding the propensity to consume.  We took a stand in 2001 that the tax cuts would be spent.  I don’t know whether they were or weren’t, but we think the data lined up pretty well with our forecasts in that period.  We took a stand once again this year that the tax rebates and the addition to disposable income would show up as increased consumer spending, and that has been the case thus far.  So we’re taking from that experience the belief that the broad construct of our story is in the right ballpark.  Some people argued that the bulk of the tax checks would just go straight into savings and would not really show up as spending.  We didn’t think that was going to happen, and we don’t think it has happened—though given the noise in the data, one can’t necessarily be sure.  \n",

I know you look at output gaps and labor market gaps, and I know the two are related; but what I’m really trying to get at is the confidence interval around this forecast.  In particular, what is the risk of a significantly greater disinflation in the context of the way you arrive at this projection? \n",

      "MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, the data on the District economy and the anecdotes that have come in indicate that, as usual, it is tracking quite closely with the national economy.  So the regional economy is improving.  Consumer spending is strengthening pretty much across the board, and some auto dealers report that this clearly will be their best year ever.  Residential construction spending remains strong.  Commercial construction for the most part remains rather soft, and I’d say the leaders of the large commercial construction firms in the District continue to be concerned about the outlook, although there has been a pickup of construction activity in some of the midsized cities in the District.  Manufacturing activity is improving overall, particularly for firms that make products related to housing.  There are some signs of improvement in employment there as well.  Although I’d say that overall employment is probably stable in the District, there are signs of some net hiring under way.  Perhaps the only reservation I’d note about the signs of improvement we’ve seen lately is that overall business attitudes still appear to be very cautious.   As far as the national outlook is concerned, the general contours of the Greenbook forecast—namely, reasonably rapid growth over the next two plus years and subdued inflation—seem to me to be fairly well grounded and justified at this point.  If I have any reservation about the forecast, it relates to the productivity/employment split.  Clearly there will be a cyclical improvement in the labor market at some point.  But the gains in employment forecast for a good chunk of next year and into 2005 strike me at this stage as somewhat unlikely, in part because I think the productivity improvement we’re seeing is going to prove to be longer-lived than the Greenbook forecasters apparently anticipate.  As far as manufacturing is concerned, I think that at some point there will be a cyclical improvement in employment in that sector as well, but I 51 of 106\f",

      "MR. REINHART.  I guess I could update the financial market quotes by now!  As Dino has already related, the message from financial markets about today’s meeting is fairly straightforward.  As indicated by the path of the expected federal funds rate in the top left panel, investors apparently anticipate that the Committee will stay with the current level of the intended federal funds rate for about one year.  As to other aspects of today’s decision, the Domestic Desk’s survey of the twenty-two primary dealers reported in the top right panel revealed that virtually all are betting that the risk assessment to be announced this afternoon will be the same as that in August.  Indeed, the probability that the nominal funds rate will touch a very low level in the next five months—inferred from Eurodollar options—has receded considerably from its height of early summer, although it has ticked up since the August employment report.  On balance, recent quotes on options produce a probability distribution for the expected funds rate—the red bars in the middle right panel—not much different from that prevailing just before the August meeting.  Two other aspects of recent financial market experience that are shown in the bottom panels are worth highlighting.  First, the chart at the left depicts a measure of the volatility of expected federal funds rates—the average of the absolute value of daily changes in futures rates—across maturities measured on the horizontal scale.  The average changes in futures rates over the past four months (the red bars) have been much smaller at short maturities than has been the norm over the prior decade (the blue bars).  Second, as shown by the bars at the bottom right, expectations about the funds rate across the maturity structure have tended to move less on average in response to the last four monthly surprises in the unemployment rate than was the historical experience.  Taken together, this suggests that the Committee has been able to anchor expectations about the very near term course of policy—in effect making them less volatile and less sensitive to revisions to the expected path of the economy.  The case for contradicting those prevailing expectations by easing policy 25 basis points at this meeting is presented in your second exhibit.  As has been a feature of the past few Greenbook forecasts, considerable resource slack is seen lingering over the next few years.  Indeed, as shown in the middle left panel, the expansion of aggregate supply is now anticipated to be sufficiently vigorous that the unemployment rate runs noticeably above the path projected by the staff in June, when the Committee last eased policy.  While monetary policy no doubt works with a lag, action today should help to foster a quicker working-down of resource slack in 2004 and 2005.  Another way of making this point is shown in the bottom panel.  Given the staff’s assessment of the forces impinging on the economy, the actual real federal funds rate is not obviously below some estimates of its equilibrium value.  The Committee may harbor doubts that the expansion of aggregate demand will have as much vigor as in the Greenbook forecast that underlies this analysis.  For example, if your own assessment of the prospects for capital spending is more similar to the “weak investment” alternative in the Greenbook than to the baseline (including the financial 75 of 106\f",
      "be seen by comparing the black bars of the baseline with the red bars depicting the alternative in the middle right panel, the unemployment rate would be more than 1 percentage point higher on average over the next two years if you held policy steady in the face of investment expanding 4 percentage points less than in the baseline, at least according to the staff model.  This scenario, however, is an alternative, not the baseline.  As outlined at the top of your next exhibit, the Committee may be willing to keep policy unchanged at this meeting if it finds both plausible and attractive the forecast in that baseline that inflation will hold fairly steady at around 1 percent, which might be seen as consistent with a working definition of price stability.  The Committee may be especially inclined to keep policy unchanged, at least for now, if it thinks that there are other sources of impetus to economic growth that may make it difficult to restrain inflation to its current pace.  In particular, as shown in the middle panel, the term structure of nominal yields is unusually steeply sloped, at least by the experience of the past twenty-five years.  As was discussed earlier, in the staff’s view this unusual configuration will not persist because longer-term yields edge lower as market participants come to see that inflation pressures remain muted and monetary policy can remain on hold for some time.  But you may feel that the staff went only part way in anticipating the market response should events in coming quarters convince investors that both inflation and the policy rate will stay on hold.  A more substantial rally in the bond market in those circumstances would probably provide considerable additional financial impetus to support capital spending and the housing market.  The other way the yield curve could shift to a more typical configuration over time is by its short end rising.  As noted by the third bullet in the top panel, this alternative seems part of the thinking of many market participants, who are apparently expecting that building pressures on inflation next year will lead you to tighten policy sooner than foreseen in the Greenbook.  Some concerns in that regard derived from the Treasury market, which is plotted in your bottom left panel.  As shown in the bottom right panel, the recent inflation forecasts of major investment banks—listed in the second column—are generally higher than the Greenbook projection, whereas their GDP growth projections, shown in the first column, are uniformly weaker than the Greenbook—an observation several you have already made.  This apparently less appealing mix of output growth and inflation on Wall Street might arise because market participants project either slower growth of aggregate supply going forward or a less benign Phillips curve—either of which would make holding steady seem more appropriate.  In addition to its rate decision, the Committee faces nettlesome questions regarding its assessment of risks to the outlook going forward, the subject of your final exhibit.  With three potential characterizations of risks—downside, balanced, and upside—to two objectives (price stability, shown along the horizontal dimension, and sustainable economic growth, shown along the vertical dimension) the current policy announcement allows nine combinations.  The Committee ended its August 76 of 106\f",
      "meeting in the blue box, in which balanced risks to the growth objective and downside risks to the inflation objective reduced to an overall assessment that the risks were tilted to the downside.  As was discussed last night, the meaning of words does matter.  If you take the phrase “sustainable economic growth” to stand in for the growth rate of potential output, then you well may envision a transition from that blue box to the yellow box directly below.  In that case, the risks are individually characterized as upside to sustainable economic growth and downside to inflation, revealing the implicit judgment that the level of output probably remains below that of its potential.  The resulting balance of those two risks depends on the welfare weights attached to those outcomes and span from upside to downside.  While it seems a stretch to consider such a change at this meeting, that shift seems more likely in the near term than to either of the boxes highlighted in red associated with balanced risks toward inflation, absent surprising developments.  A more immediate concern is whether to retain the last sentence of the August statement, which, as shown in the box at the lower left, held  that “the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”  In last night’s meeting, most members expressed discomfort with extending some form of commitment about the future path of the policy rate.  At the same time, some noted that, in unusual circumstances, guidance offered to market participants about near-term intentions could amplify the effectiveness of policy.  It is probably the case that the sentence about “a considerable period” helped to anchor near-term expectations about policy in a manner reflected in the unusual behavior of futures rates I reported on at the start of my briefing.  But if you see the need for tightening closer down the road than, say, in staff forecast, you may want to begin thinking at this time about an exit strategy from this part of the statement.  Market attention to those words and the likely reaction were they to be excised, however, may make you hesitate to head for that exit too abruptly.  There is one aspect of the current sentence and one potential wording change that might blunt a tendency for market participants to view the statement as a hard promise to keep the funds rate at its current level—the notion so many of you objected to last night.  The first applies as a matter of meaning once again.  The Committee has indicated its expectation that policy can be kept accommodative for a considerable period.  Determining whether the stance of policy is accommodative is a matter of judgment in setting the real funds rate some distance below an estimate of its equilibrium value.  In circumstances in which economic fundamentals are improving, the stance of policy can be kept accommodative, even with increases in the nominal policy rate, as long as the associated rising real rate does not move up faster than the rising equilibrium real rate.  It is instructive that, as shown in the lower right panel, the Committee has been describing its policy as accommodative since additional policy easings.  That said, market participants seem to have rebased their view on what is accommodative to the current setting of policy.  To avoid disappointment in financial markets at some later date, it will be important that public statements as a rule do not equate accommodative policy with the current level of the 77 of 106\f",
      "nominal short rate.  Second, the Committee might want to shade its current implicit commitment away from being based on a period measured in chronological time to one determined by economic events.  For instance, the Committee could assert that its judgment was that policy could stay accommodative for the considerable period it currently assesses will be required to foster the containing of disinflationary pressures.  That concludes my prepared remarks. \n",

      "MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, given the strength of the economy that we see, at least on the basis of the most recent data, I support leaving the funds rate at 1 percent.  However, even with the expected pickup in growth, there’s an uncomfortably high risk that inflation may move lower than would be desirable.  Certainly in the Greenbook, with the revision to productivity, it’s clear that the gap is probably greater today than we thought was the case in the past.   I favor retaining our current risk assessments, with the risks being balanced for growth and weighted toward the downside for inflation.  But I do want to make a parenthetic point.  When I read the Bluebook and heard Vincent’s presentation, I was struck by the case that was made for an easing.  In particular, one or two scenarios seemed to indicate that an easing might be appropriate as something of an insurance policy—and one that I can’t see as having any cost.  So I would suggest that, if indeed there is a perceptible lull in the economy, we ought to jump on the chance to ease and the exit strategy will not be an issue. \n",

On the balance of risks statement, I agree to a large extent, though not entirely, with what President Santomero said, which was to change as little as possible in that statement.  I would reserve these changes until we agree on what we mean by the words we use.  I think it would be a big mistake to start changing them at this meeting before we go through the stress-test that President Moskow suggested last night.  So in my view we ought to keep the balance of risks wording exactly as it is now until we have time to think about it more thoroughly. As for the balance itself, I happen to agree with the current assessment.  I think the risks are balanced even on my definition of sustainable growth, which isn’t everybody’s, given that we have strong demand but very weak labor markets.  So whether the output gap will close over the next few quarters is a very open question.  In that sense the risks are balanced, as stated in the first sentence of that paragraph.  I do think we have persisting risks of disinflation, so I agree with the second sentence and also the sentence that sums up our assessment of the risks. On the “considerable period” sentence, I think we need to set ourselves up sooner rather than later to get to the exit strategy.  This is where I part forces with President Santomero a little.  I believe this wording is moving toward an economic rationale, and I’d prefer to get going in that direction.  We can’t be sure where the economy is going to be in coming months and when we’re going to need that rationale, so the sooner we get there the better.  With regard to Governor Gramlich’s suggestion that we drop “considerable period,” I believe it’s going to be a big deal when we do that.  Getting to that point very rapidly would have market repercussions.  I think it would be interpreted as a signal that we were getting ready to do something that we’re not 86 of 106\f",

Regarding the last sentence, I think the phrase that it is important to retain is “considerable period.”  The phrase that I think is going to get a lot of attention is “to foster the containing of. ”  It will likely be the focus of attention just because it is awkward.  It would be less awkward if we dropped the participle and just said “to contain disinflationary forces.”  But to do so would be to promise more than monetary policy can probably deliver.

      "MR. STOCKTON.  I guess I’m forced to say “no”!  [Laughter]  We still think that in essence the equilibrium real funds rate is going to be below its historical average by the end of 2005.  One reason is that the level of the dollar is still relatively high despite the fact that it has come down.  Second, the investment share in GDP is still quite low relative to its historical average.  Now, as we look further beyond the end of 2005, we do think it would be reasonable to expect a return of the equilibrium real funds rate back to its historical average of 2½ percent or so; we think that’s the direction you’ll be headed toward at that point.  But we don’t see that process as occurring so rapidly that the market’s expectation is the one that we want to buy into for the end of 2005.  That might be the case looking down a couple more years, but not in 2005.   In part there’s another factor that boosts the equilibrium rate further down the road but that in the intermediate term is providing us with the capacity for noninflationary growth, and that is that we’re expecting a further acceleration in potential output growth sometime beyond 2005.  As the improvement in investment that we’re forecasting occurs, it lifts potential capital services and provides a bit more space for the economy to grow.  Again, in the long run that obviously is a factor why interest rates would need to be somewhat higher.  But over the intermediate period it allows rates to be somewhat lower. \n",

      "MR. STOCKTON.  Well, I have a hard time imagining that the NIPA revisions are going to alter the output and inflation nexus fundamentally.  The unemployment rate is not going to be affected at all by this, of course.  The price figures, although they get revised, tend not to be revised dramatically or persistently enough for the relationships in our inflation equations to change.  One area in which we could see changes big enough to affect underlying parameters in the model might be investment spending.  For example, if there’s a significant revision in software investment—we saw one the last time there was a NIPA revision—that could influence our thinking about what is happening with the long-run share of software investment relative to overall output. That in turn could affect our potential GDP forecast and our view of what investment spending is likely to be over the next few quarters.  Similarly, if we get big revisions on the income side, that could alter the saving rate enough perhaps to change our view about the sensitivity of consumer spending and saving to wealth.   \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth District economy continues to improve, and our business contacts have become somewhat more optimistic about the outlook.  Let me talk a little about the labor markets. They remain soft but are showing some signs of firming.  According to some of the payroll data we’ve looked at, employment was flat for our District in September.  However, layoff announcements are down from earlier in the year, and more firms say that they are planning to hire or are thinking about hiring.  I would note anecdotally that firms announcing job increases in the last couple of months include several call centers, a major railroad, several manufacturers in our area, and a number of high-tech firms in Colorado.  To the relief of people in both Kansas City and Tulsa, American Airlines decided not to lay off workers at its two large maintenance facilities in those cities. On the manufacturing side, activity actually strengthened further.  Production and new orders both increased, and expectations for future production and orders remained relatively high.  Capital spending also improved somewhat.  Although employment remained below year-ago levels, the average workweek did rise noticeably.  On the negative side, aircraft manufacturing continued to struggle, with little improvement expected until 2005.  I would note that from August to September the year-over-year production index from our survey of manufacturers rose from 8 to 17, the new orders index climbed from 22 to 31, and the capital spending index improved from 0 to 12.  Moreover, preliminary data received for October as late as yesterday suggest that these trends persisted in October. Consumer spending continued to edge up despite the softer labor market that I mentioned.  Retailers contacted also said that they had had pretty good sales and their confidence remained strong.  Housing activity increased further, setting new records in most of the areas except for Denver where it’s a little slower.  Commercial real estate does remain weak in the 50 of 126\f",
      "region, and energy activity is expanding but at a moderate pace.  State and local budgets show further signs of improvement, with some tax revenue increases in several of our states.  But I would caution that to some extent those numbers reflect tax increases.  On the agricultural side, forecasts for net income have moved up as much as 22 percent over last year.  But I would remind you that about $20 billion of federal farm payments are included in those numbers.   Let me turn to the national outlook.  The economic forces are in place for a relatively robust recovery.  That assessment is based on current monetary policy, fiscal policy, productivity, and a good strong financial system that can support credit needs going forward.  Overall, I expect growth through the end of next year to be above 4 percent, a little better than the Blue Chip consensus but not quite as strong as the Greenbook forecast.  As noted, a recovery in capital spending and an increase in employment remain two risks to our achieving sustainable economic growth.  But I’m hearing about some increases in capital spending from the people we talk to, and we see some evidence of it in the numbers.  In my conversations with CEOs in the District, there’s a clear sense of greater confidence and an indication that firms are more willing to undertake planned expansions.  So I’m optimistic about that.  We also are beginning to see some signs that labor markets are responding to the acceleration in growth over the past several months.  The evidence is very preliminary and tentative, I realize, but I think it bodes well for the labor markets going forward.   Turning to the inflation outlook, I would say that, in the near term, inflation is likely to remain stable and that the risks going forward are about balanced.  A continued decline in the dollar could put upward pressure on inflation.  Although the output gap may put some downward pressure on inflation, I am reluctant to put a lot of weight on that gap as a predictor of inflation.  51 of 126\f",
      "Research here and elsewhere suggests that the predictive powers of the output gap on inflation are difficult to find. Finally, on the topic of policy let me say that I clearly would be of the view that for now we should maintain policy where it is.  I think any change would actually be harmful in the current environment.  However, given recent data, I’m not convinced that we can define a period within which we can keep rates this low.  I also think it’s important that the public come to realize, as President Parry suggested, that an accommodative policy refers to the level of the funds rate and not to the direction of any change.  Although I do not have a point estimate of the long-run equilibrium for the funds rate, it probably is more likely in a range of 3 to 4 percent than near 1 percent.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At every meeting we have to do three things: (1) assess the economy and risks to the outlook, (2) decide the policy implications, and (3) talk about communication.  Recognizing that the third topic is going to be exciting today—one hopes—I’ll try to be brief on the first two.   On the assessment of the economy, it’s clear that the third and fourth quarters seem to be extremely robust.  One recognizes obviously, as Ned Gramlich just mentioned, that the pattern particularly with respect to real PCE growth did slow a little in September.  But that doesn’t leave me with any great concern.  I think the overall pattern of PCE growth is still well maintained.  Similarly, I would point to the demand for both new and existing homes as being very strong; and this morning’s data on shipments and orders also suggest that the third and fourth quarters are likely to be very robust.  Fortunately, it also appears that the sources of the turnaround seem to be broadening somewhat.  The industrial sector is starting to show some signs of strength.  Industrial production appears to have expanded in the third quarter, and it’s possible that capacity utilization is also starting to firm somewhat.  I’d say that the labor market, which is the biggest question mark we’ve been dealing with, does seem to be giving some early signs of stabilizing.  We haven’t talked much about it in this room today but when the September jobs data came out, that got quite a bit of attention in the press, and we shouldn’t forget that the news was positive.  Similarly, the revisions to the job declines in July and August were all in the right direction and were consistent with a gradual bottoming of the labor market.  The four-week moving average of initial claims declined a bit, and the household survey data suggested that layoffs might be subsiding.  So overall I’d say that the Greenbook was right in terms of moving up expectations for the third and fourth quarters.   65 of 126\f",
      "That leads to the second issue, which is how one assesses the future.  In that regard I can understand and generally feel reasonably comfortable with the logic of the Greenbook forecast.  The Greenbook assumes that the step-up in productivity will continue, though it hasn’t taken in all the increases recently as permanent.  The stimulative policies plus some assumptions about multiplier and accelerator effects all result in an economy that grows at about 5 percent per year, creates jobs and wealth, and then has the unemployment rate falling gradually.  As President Broaddus said, the Greenbook forecast is certainly easy to love.  If I were from the Dallas District I’d probably have a catchy tune about how easy love may be fleeting love.  [Laughter]   Let me talk about the risks that are associated with this forecast.  I think it’s easy to see risks on the downside, as Cathy has pointed out.  One of the risks is that so much of what happened in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter seems to have been driven by policy stimulus.  Real pre-tax income was essentially unchanged during the summer months of the year.  As that effect starts to wane, there’s a possibility that we won’t get quite the kind of uptick that the Greenbook expects.  And while David and Vincent gave us a number of stories, if you will, about why demand for C&I loans has been very slow to turn around, the bankers I’ve talked to certainly are worried about it.  They seem to think that it may really be a sign of slower growth than the Greenbook forecast suggests.  I recently had a meeting with the real estate roundtable, and across the board that group was quite subdued.  So some anecdotal information suggests that our staff forecast is a bit more hopeful than many people, at least many in the real world, are at this stage.  Add to that the fact that the Greenbook forecast is already above the Blue Chip consensus, and it seems that some concern about the downside risks is warranted. On the upside, though, I think one must say that rarely at this stage of an expansion has the economy seen this kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus—with interest rates extremely low, 66 of 126\f",
      "prices stable, the dollar coming off, productivity increasing, financial conditions turning, and earnings relatively strong.  Those and a variety of other factors could lead to some upside potential around the forecast.  So I’d say that even around our relatively optimistic forecast, while love may be fleeting, the risks are relatively balanced. With respect to policy, I suspect that, when we get to that point of our discussion, there’s not going to be very much to say.  With respect to communication I, like others, will restrain myself as best I can except to say that I believe the interaction between policy and communication today is such that the Committee would be very well advised to take a fairly cautious approach.  We have a great deal to discuss, and I’d hate for us to get ahead of ourselves in the statement that we make at 2:15 today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MS. MINEHAN.  I realize that this discussion is going on a little longer than we probably all expected, but let me just follow up with one more question.  In the ’90s I think all of us were struck by the degree to which companies said that they were never going to raise prices.  They felt that global competition or domestic competition or whatever one wants to call it had put them in a position of not viewing price increases as an option available to them.  There were a lot of factors helping them in that regard, particularly in terms of the cost of labor.  They were paying people with stock options, which they didn’t have to account for.  The stock market was helping on benefit costs.  The rate of increase in health costs was going down at the time.  There were any number of accounting tricks that we now know companies were using to figure out how to show a level of earnings and revenues and so forth that the market expected.  More recently we’ve had slow growth in demand, but at the same time the factors that kept the costs associated with hiring people low have all disappeared.  Firms don’t have the same beneficial impact from benefit programs.  Health costs are clearly escalating.  Businesses can no longer pay people in ways that are not transparent; those costs have to be accounted for in some fashion or another, at least for most companies.  Clearly the emphasis on improving productivity is a reflection of the desire not to increase prices.  But I’m wondering if we are still hearing with the same intensity the view that raising prices is just not something that firms would ever consider doing again.   \n",

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since the last FOMC meeting, economic activity in the Sixth District has continued to expand at a reasonable pace, with strength fairly broadly based.  Compared with the rest of the nation, the region’s growth appears robust, suggesting that our area may be leading again as we did in the recovery from the 1990-91 recession. To illustrate the breadth of the strength we’re seeing regionally, retailers are upbeat about sales in recent weeks, and prospects for the holiday season appear to be better than last year.  Auto sales, which had weakened in October, bounced back in November.  Commercial real estate markets are improving, especially retail and distribution expansions.  Residential housing markets remain generally stable at very high levels.  While office vacancy rates remain high, we’re now getting positive absorption with subleased space no longer coming back on the outlook for the winter season, especially for cruises.  Visitors from Europe are returning, buoyed by an appreciating euro, although traffic from Latin America has dropped.  This is the third FOMC briefing in a row in which we’ve had reports from our banking sector suggesting that loan demand is picking up, primarily in the service sector but with some new borrowing now showing up for commercial real estate projects and manufacturing.  Trade and transportation activity improved in the District.  Indeed, truck manufacturers are noting a sharp increase in orders.  One local trailer manufacturer said that his company had an inventory of 1700 trailers just six months ago and today they are struggling to keep up with demand.  They have a backlog of orders through the end of the first quarter.   The District is also leading the nation in job growth, as it did coming out of the 1990-91 recession.  Recent job momentum for Georgia in particular was exceeded by only two states, and metro Atlanta had the fastest job growth in recent months of any metropolitan area in the 49 of 133\f",
      "country.  It’s difficult to pinpoint a distinct source for this growth, such as a few large employers bringing back workers.  All indications are that, outside of manufacturing, it’s quite broad based. The rise in employment is being reflected in improving state sales tax and income tax receipts.  Every state in the District now has an unemployment rate below that for the nation, and Georgia’s stands at 4.2 percent.  That said, it’s also true that job growth in our District is considerably more muted this time than in the post-recession period in the early ’90s.  We have yet to see the surge that would significantly push down unemployment rates.       As for inflation, price increases still appear muted except for health care and the pass- through of higher natural gas prices.  We also hear some scattered anecdotal reports of higher prices in trucking, where shortages of equipment are beginning to affect truck and trailer prices.   On the national front, I count myself among those skeptics who were surprised by the sheer strength of the third-quarter growth and productivity numbers.  Perhaps even more encouraging are the signs that investment has begun to pick up and the signs of life in labor begun, further complementing the other signals.  All this bodes well for this year and next.  I, like others, expect some slowdown in the fourth quarter from the third, but I do anticipate that 2004 will be even stronger than 2003.  Any quibbles I might have with the Greenbook over point estimates for growth are minor because the baseline forecast path in the Greenbook is consistent with our own Atlanta model forecast.  I find it more difficult to work through the longer-term outlook for inflation and to reconcile the Greenbook’s very benign outlook with the somewhat earlier upturn in the inflation path suggested by private-sector forecasters, some of our own modeling work, and financial 50 of 133\f",
      "reflecting fundamentals in one way or another.  Those fundamentals include money growth for several years in excess of the nominal rate of economic growth, real interest rates near zero or negative, a surge in government spending with very large short-term deficits, a drop in the value of the dollar, a growing trade deficit, and increased leanings toward trade protectionism.  I would conclude that the inflation risks are currently close to balanced.  The growth that we have seen recently and that we expect to continue into next year certainly reduces the probability of worrisome further disinflation. That should remind us as well as others that inflation could move sooner than expected in the other direction. Looking ahead just a bit to the policy discussion, I would guess that there will be a sense that we continue to have the luxury of being able to be patient in terms of adjusting the stance of policy.  At the same time, we’re at a point where we can and should begin to turn more attention to the longer term and the process of ultimately adjusting policy, hopefully gracefully, initially back to a more neutral setting.  In preparation for those later discussions, I would suggest that our ultimate policy adjustment would need to take careful account of certain existing conditions in the economy that may affect the underlying policy transmission channels. What I have in mind is the following:  Approximately 40 percent of the increase in GDP since the trough is due to housing and durable goods purchases, which usually need to be financed and were clearly encouraged and supported by low interest rates.  Measures of consumer debt produced by the Board’s staff show that consumers clearly have increased their debt burdens and their financial obligation ratios.  Delinquency rates on subprime mortgages far exceed those of other mortgages.  Finally, while credit card lenders remain profitable, their chargeoff ratios are now approaching 7 percent.  As a result, current profit levels are being maintained by low commercial paper funding costs and not by increased charges on loans. 51 of 133\f",
      "Should we raise rates too high too quickly this time, we risk choking off demand for housing and durables, a situation that will be exacerbated by a profit squeeze on lenders, particularly credit card lenders, who will be forced to curtail lending or tighten standards.  There’s also a risk, with business investment still tentative, that precipitous rate hikes might heighten businessmen’s risk aversion and lead them to postpone planned investment.  But smaller rate hikes might have a greater economic impact this time than in previous expansions.  These structural issues suggest to me that we may need to be more concerned than usual about exactly what evidence or signals we will need to see to trigger a preemptive policy reversal, given the lags in the transmission of policy.  These considerations also seem to argue for preparing people at the right time for a smooth transition to a less accommodative policy.  It’s nice to come to a point where we can begin to sort through those longer-term issues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic news since our last meeting has been heartening.  The odds that we have begun a strong and sustainable expansion have risen significantly.  Because of the rise in growth, we’re going to see even more op-ed articles, wire stories, and editorials opining that the Fed needs to tighten soon to avoid a repeat of 1980s-style inflation.  The Wall Street Journal today has an editorial along those lines.  I believe these critics are not particularly well informed and that, as a Committee, we should continue to remain patient and not choke off growth unnecessarily.  In particular, though of course we have to be vigilant to detect any change in the inflation trend, the odds of inflation rising significantly any time soon from its current very low level seem small.  Let me make a few points.  First, those on the Street and elsewhere who lately have been worrying about inflation have tended to point primarily to raw materials prices, which have been rising, and to the dollar, which has been falling.  Here I will largely reiterate some things that Dave Stockton said.  The Board staff’s Monday briefing, which I believe has been posted electronically, debunked the importance of the raw materials argument quite convincingly in my view.  The briefing includes a graph of the historical data, which shows that even very large movements of raw materials prices—which are quite common by the way—appear to have muted effects on intermediate goods prices and, most important, no discernible effects at all on final goods inflation.  Presumably this lack of inflationary impact reflects the fact that raw materials are only a small part of total costs.  As another figure in the briefing showed, unit labor costs— which, of course, have been falling rapidly as productivity has surged and wage growth has slowed—are far more important in inflation determination than are materials prices.   An analysis similar to that for raw materials would apply to the dollar.  As we’ve been seeing, large movements of the dollar against major currencies tend to translate into smaller 79 of 133\f",
      "movements against the U.S. trade-weighted basket of currencies and into still smaller effects on import prices because of imperfect pass-throughs.  Nonoil import prices, in turn, are a relatively modest part of the overall price index.  In short, the ultimate effect of the dollar depreciation of the magnitude we have seen on broad measures of core inflation is likely to be quite small indeed. I noted the key role of unit labor costs in inflation.  Of course, unit labor costs will not continue to fall at the recent rate.  Indeed, as employment picks up, productivity growth in particular will slow markedly.  Critics may point to this decline in productivity growth as another incipient source of inflationary pressure.  I would just note that this prospective productivity Greenbook forecast assumes that productivity growth will fall significantly below trend in 2004 and 2005 as employment picks up, specifically to 1.7 percent in 2004 and to only 0.5 percent in 2005.  Given recent experience, it seems entirely possible that these assumptions are conservative and that productivity growth, though decelerating, will nevertheless be higher than what the staff has assumed for the next two years.  If so, that would tend to increase the risks of further disinflation. Finally, although output gaps are of course very hard to measure, the weight of the evidence continues to support those who believe that considerable slack remains in the economy.  Let me give one bit of evidence on this point.  The recent New York Times article by Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee argued that the rise in the unemployment rate in the past two years understates the degree of labor market weakness.  The reason is that today a large percentage of job losers, a greater fraction than in the past, simply withdraw from the labor force, for example, to apply for Social Security disability benefits.  I looked at data on the ratio of employment to the 80 of 133\f",
      "working age population, which combine information on both unemployment and labor force participation and found that they confirm this general observation.  Between its peak in April 2000 and its trough this past September, the employment-to-population ratio fell 2.8 percentage points.  With the strong gains in the household survey of the past two months, the net decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2000 is still 2.4 percentage points.  For comparison, the combination of the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions, during which the unemployment rate peaked near 11 percent, produced a peak-to-trough move in this ratio between September 1979 and February 1983 of 3.0 percentage points.  The decline attributed to the 1981-82 recession alone from its local peak in April ’81 until February ’83 was 2.5 percentage points.  So on this particular metric—and of course it’s only one metric—the deterioration of the labor market from 2000 until now is comparable to what occurred during the deep 1981-82 recession.  For comparison, the movement in the employment-to-population ratio from its peak to its trough during the 1990-91 recession period was 2.0 percentage points. Possibly the extent of the recent decline is exaggerated because employment was unsustainably high in 1999 and 2000.  However, even relative to a more neutral benchmark of 5 percent unemployment and a participation rate at its long-run trend, current household employment—the more optimistic of the surveys—remains some 2.9 million jobs below normal.  That number fully incorporates the rise in self-employment about which much has been made.  On balance, the large decline in the share of the population that is working suggests that employment can rise significantly before we see pressure on wages and unit labor costs.     To summarize, vigilance on inflation is absolutely essential.  I do not disagree with that one bit.  But we should not overreact to purported signs of inflation that are in reality no such thing.

My logic is that we are in the northwest and we want to get to the northeast, or from low inflation as the predominant concern to a balanced inflation risk assessment.  I think the statement you propose migrates us over.  I’m not so sure it’s a bad idea—it might be a good idea—to get rid of that overall balance of risks statement when it becomes very awkward, and this meeting may be one of those times.

It’s very short.  “The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity.  The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly, and the labor market appears to be improving modestly.  Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.” \n",

I’ll be reading the directive wording on page 15 of the Bluebook and, with regard to risk assessments, the first two sentences that the Chairman read to you from the draft press release.  That’s what is being voted on.  With regard to the directive itself:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.”  With regard to the sentences going into the press statement:  “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.” \n",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  We’re leaving it to the Committee to decide whether or not we should have a risk-assessment or a forward-looking element in our statement.  I don’t think we felt that it was appropriate for our little subgroup to do anything more than to say that it is clearly an option not to have that in the statement.  We’re not taking that option away from you.  We can follow a process in which we first side with those—if it is the majority view—who want us to try to work on this approach.  We can certainly do that.  But nothing in taking that step precludes the Committee from ultimately deciding that it doesn’t want to go down this path.  I do agree, however, that some of these options would imply a meeting that starts earlier or goes later than is currently the case, and I’m not sure that the Committee wants to do that.  I have one thing to do here because I have some notes from the last meeting that four members—Governor Bies, and Presidents Santomero, Hoenig, and McTeer—weren’t able to speak on this topic because it was close to 2:00 p.m. and we had to adjourn.  I don’t know if any of you four wants to jump in at this stage, but I will call on you in that order.  I also have Governor Gramlich and President Parry as indicating today that they want to say something.  But as a matter of courtesy and organizational discipline, I think we owe to those who were precluded from speaking last time an opportunity to comment today if they wish.

      "MR. FERGUSON. Well, I guess I’m going to have the last words because we have only a few minutes left.  Here’s what I’ve noted.  I heard a range of views about these three options, but I don’t think I heard anyone say let’s not stress-test them.  Some of you may ultimately say it’s too complicated and let’s not go to a new type of statement, but I didn’t hear anyone say “please stop the process now.”  So I think we need to continue this process, perhaps broadening the stress testing a little, to make sure we pick up a range of situations that we know have occurred over the last five years.  I’m not sure we have to do that for every meeting because one can recall that there were a series of meetings when inflation looked as if it was picking up and a series of meetings when it looked as though inflation was falling off.  So as long as we cover that wide range of circumstances, I think we can respond to the issues raised about stress testing. The second thing I heard clearly was that we have to keep on the table two options that aren’t specifically set out in this material.  One is simply to cut back on the press statement altogether and minimize the forward-looking aspects of it.  So we’ll include that clearly as an option to be discussed, but there’s no stress testing to do on that—or no more that our little working group can do with regard to that option.   I’d say the same thing with respect to the focus on the minutes being released early. That’s clearly something that people want to talk about.  We have to leave enough time in our two-day meeting to cover that, though it’s slightly independent from this other aspect of our communications policy.  We already had planned to discuss expediting the minutes and, as I said, I think that requires some input from Board staff on how they think the market may react, and the pros and cons of taking that step, et cetera.  Those two issues—what to do on the statement and the minutes—do interact a little.  As Michelle has warned us a few times, if we appear to be stepping back from transparency in the statement but are giving something else in 117 of 133\f",
      "its stead, that will make a difference in the public reaction.  So those two decisions are interrelated to a degree.  While I in some sense share Bob McTeer’s frustration about the bias statement—had we never voted on a tilt we’d never have to disclose it—our problem is that we’ve voted on a tilt for many years.  So eliminating that would lead to great market consternation.  So, of course, we can’t wind the tape back to whenever it was that the Committee Those are the three things I hear.  The fourth is that, as Ned Gramlich said, in some sense the length of our meetings is a relevant factor in all of this.  I don’t know what the right answer is to that.  But I would say that it’s certainly something we are going to have to consider.  If Ned is right, and I think to some degree he is—we’re setting interest rates at least for the world’s largest and most complex economy if not for the world—the attempt of nineteen people to do that in three hours may be more than we can manage.  We may no longer be at a stage where we can do that.  We may decide that we’re no longer just setting rates but we’re talking about the economy and setting up the implications for policy in the future.  We’re setting rates, we’re trying to figure out how best to explain it, and we’re looking forward.  That’s a lot for nineteen people to do in three hours.   about that. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  I spent a lot of time digging into the history of this, reading the memorandums of discussion from the early 1960s and the transcript—I think from 1990—when warehousing was discussed at length by the Committee.  I want to discuss the wisdom of our having that warehousing authority.  If we look at the domestic portfolio, the Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Federal Reserve from buying obligations directly from the Treasury, though there is a $3 billion emergency line, if you will, that the Treasury can call on to sell obligations directly to us.  And I think that that’s a sound provision.  We do not have an obligation to buy—and in fact, we cannot under the Federal Reserve Act—unlimited amounts from the Treasury.  The problem on the warehousing side—given the history on this and given that the Treasury clearly has the lead responsibility on international issues—is that, when the Treasury comes to us and says it wants another $5 billion, we can find ourselves in a box under present circumstances.  I think it puts us in a very awkward position. In my view there’s something to be said for making the warehousing limit $3 billion, which would correspond to the $3 billion emergency amount available on the domestic side.  I think that would send the right message—that the Treasury does not have an unlimited line on the Federal Reserve.  My goal would be to try to prevent our being in the situation where, because the Treasury takes the lead on the international side, somehow the view is that we’re supposed to ante up whenever the Treasury asks us to.  That’s the awkwardness that I see in this situation. \n",

But I think that’s different from actually operating in those securities.  Yes, we would learn a little from some hands-on experience, but we would have to outsource a good deal of the work, buy forecasts, and do a lot of things that we really don’t need to do to understand the market.  I’m sure there are people at the New York Federal Reserve Bank who do understand this market.  The fact that we had these memos is proof of it.

      "MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you.  This exercise shows us that achieving clarity and transparency for a large and diverse committee is quite difficult.  But it’s also very important both in our role as a public institution and for the efficacy of monetary policy.  So I hope, even though it’s a very difficult task, that we don’t let ourselves backslide in this effort. I want to say that I’m actually sympathetic to the view of gradual evolution in the policy statement.  We saw last week a statement by the Bank of Canada that was quite a model of clarity.  In simple English it explained conditions in the economy, and it explained why policy steps were taken.  In that respect I thought it conveyed everything without the need for formulaic language.  But as we go to a simpler and shorter statement, I would hope that we would increase the information we provide in other dimensions, particularly the minutes and our individual projections—and we’ll come back to that later. Let me say a word about the statements.  Very briefly, I agree with President Stern.  My preference among the three statements would be levels A for two reasons.  The first is that I do think it’s important to describe the outlook in terms of levels relative to benchmarks.  The changes statement requires unspecified preliminary language in order to make it clear, which I think is a major drawback to that statement. My second point has to do with the conditioning policy assumption.  A number of central banks do use the constant interest rate assumption in making their projections.  This assumption has been very strongly criticized by a number of observers, including Glenn Rudebusch and Lars Svenson and by Mike Woodford in his book and other places.  There are two problems with the constant interest rate assumption.  One is theoretical, and the other is practical, and they’re related.  At the theoretical level, the constant interest rate assumption is usually not well defined in the sense that many forward-looking rational expectations models simply do not have 28 of 238\f",
      "equilibriums or they have multiple equilibriums under that assumption, whereas backward-looking models tend to diverge and have unstable behavior.  In practice, that means showing paths in the projections that look very unrealistic.  As a practical matter, the constant interest rate assumption is really not well specified because it doesn’t specify what financial markets believe, for example.  Do they believe that interest rates are going to be constant, or do they have the current market revealed preferences?  How long will the constant interest rate path be maintained?  What would be the policy after that path has ended?  It’s not really a very useful conditioning assumption, and therefore, I just warn you that there are some serious reservations about that approach.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you.  When Roger called me and I asked him if an option was “none of the above,” I shuddered, thinking that I’d be the only one with that preference.  But I gather from the comments thus far that I’m not alone.  So let me just say up front that I certainly share the view that we ought to resist the temptation to tinker at the margin at this point. I, too, found the working group and staff papers helpful, but for a reason other than the reasons that have already been articulated.  I think those materials exposed some very fundamental issues that we simply haven’t come to grips with.  I would suggest that the more we’ve tried to say and the more we’ve tried to sharpen up the language of our post-meeting statements, the more we have bumped into some very frustrating fundamentals that I don’t think we’ve begun to agree on around this table.  Not only is that going to get in the way with regard to what to say in our post-meeting statements, but I think it’s going to carry over into the discussion of the minutes.  In that regard, I don’t think we’ve really decided what information we ought to provide to the public.  I agree with Presidents Minehan and McTeer that we have not even necessarily agreed that we ought to be in the business of providing short-term—and I underscore short-term—guidance to financial markets.  We differ in our views as to whether that has been helpful and appropriate.  In my opinion, it has created a very short-term focus on policy that has not been terribly helpful.  So to my mind there are some very fundamental questions along those lines.  I don’t think we’ve even begun to deal with some of the basic questions about how to communicate our policy objectives and benchmarks.  In fact, we haven’t even agreed on the definition of some of the very fundamental terms that Vincent highlighted, such as “sustainable growth,” “long-term potential,” and “price stability.”  Until we’ve defined those kinds of terms among ourselves, it 32 of 238\f",
      "seems to me that such concepts as “gaps” have no meaning.  They certainly have no independent meaning; they have meaning only in the context of the Phillips curve framework, a construct on which at least some of us have very different views.  So how do we anchor the forward-looking portion of our post-meeting statements on some kind of agreed-upon targets and objectives?  The notion of our targets and objectives creeps into those statements even by the way we construct them now.  What is the relationship between the post-FOMC statements and the semiannual Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress?  Those are questions we need to talk about, and I think we’ll have some interesting discussions  In sum, my view of the work that has been done is that we should use it to highlight some of the very fundamental issues that I think are going to be with us whether we’re talking about the post-meeting statements or the minutes.  Until we can come to grips with those issues, I think we’re going to continue to struggle.  And the more we try to say, the more difficult it will be for us to be comfortable with the post-meeting statements.  I’d like to come back and add some further thoughts when we talk about the minutes and our semiannual forecasts.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  We’re using the word “evolution” here.  If I could use a genetic analogy, I think we want to be careful that we have some highly selected breeding and not random mutation.  [Laughter]  To begin my remarks, let me reflect a bit on how we got to where we are—some of the past evolution.  Originally, of course, there was no statement issued at the end of the meeting, not even a release of the policy decision.  I think it was in the early ’80s that the Committee started to vote on a bias or asymmetry in the directive, but that was not released until a few days after the next meeting.  Then in 1994, almost ten years ago to the day, the Committee agreed to release its policy decision on the day of the meeting.  Initially the practice was to make an announcement when there was a change in the intended federal funds rate and no statement otherwise.  So, clearly, the original idea was to provide an explanation of what we had done and why.  After all, a decision to keep the intended funds rate unchanged is also a policy decision, but we did not have a statement at the end of every meeting.  So the original idea was to explain why we did what we did.  A little after that we made the decision—and I think this was after I came on board—to release the bias statement.  Subsequently the bias was viewed as a problem, and we substituted the balance of risk statement for reasons that we discussed at length.  I won’t go into that.  Now we seem to be focusing on the balance of risk statement, and to me we’re not focusing adequately on the explanation of why we acted as we did and what the background was for our decision.  There have been many expressions of unhappiness with a formulaic approach or standard language, so I raise this point.  To me the problem is not so much with standard language but that there is no way to construct standard language or any other kind of language that does a good job on a forward-looking commitment—or quasi-commitment or whatever it is—regarding where policy is going to go in the future.  But I do think it is quite possible to come up with some 36 of 238\f",
      "standard phrases or summary phrases to describe the policy decision that was taken.  Now, that’s not the issue the working group investigated.  What it did investigate and what I think is being revealed in this discussion is that it is very hard to come up with standard language—and I’ll predict any language—that we would regard as satisfactory in terms of the forward-looking nature of the policy decisions.  I think we need to provide forward-looking information about where we expect the economy to go and that probably has to be nuanced depending on the facts case by case and meeting by meeting.  But I believe that we ought to be able to come up with some standard language that says, for example, that we decided to raise the federal funds rate for this basic reason or we decided to leave it alone for this basic reason. \n",

One of the categories in which we saw huge price declines in the fourth quarter was used cars, which was probably related to the price incentives on new cars.  Those declines were big enough to matter for the actual total price indexes.  We looked at that, and we didn’t expect prices for used cars to bounce back up, but then again we didn’t think they would continue to go down at a double-digit pace either.  As we went through other categories, it seemed to us that in the last couple of months the prices for some particular categories were affected a lot by special circumstances.  We saw that early in the year, too, when prices in certain categories moved up and then down or moved down and then back up again, and the three-month change in core inflation moved around a lot relative to the twelve-month change.  I think we showed a chart in the pre-FOMC briefings several times last year depicting that pattern.  The two series are converging and are fairly close together—the latest three-month change is a little below the twelve-month change—so we do think that prices are a little low now and will probably move up a bit in coming months.

      "MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Twelfth District continues to gain momentum.  For example, retailers in the West had an encouraging holiday season, with considerably stronger sales this year than last year.  Spending by businesses is also picking up.  The bulk of our contacts say that they will increase capital spending going forward, citing plans to replace both IT and non-IT equipment.  One machine tool maker tells us that her order book is full for the entire year.  District computer makers like Hewlett-Packard have seen sharp increases in demand, helping to boost output for semiconductors and in turn semiconductor equipment.  Commercial aerospace has yet to see a pickup in capital spending; however, folks in Washington State breathed a sigh of relief when Boeing decided last month to go forward with developing the new 7E7 and to assemble the planes in the Seattle area.  Overall, the labor nonfarm payrolls in the Twelfth District outside California are back up to pre-recession levels.   In California, a new governor and to some extent an improved economic outlook have motivated lawmakers to break the gridlock and tackle the state’s accumulated and long-term budget shortfall.  In late December, legislators voted to place a long-term deficit reduction bond and a state reserve fund requirement on the March 2 ballot.  The deficit reduction bond would refinance the state’s accumulated deficit from the current and previous budget years.  At this point, polls show limited public support for the initiative, but the governor and the state’s comptroller have started a big push to convince voters to approve the ballot measures.  A few weeks ago, the governor turned his attention to the state’s long-run structural gap, proposing a multiyear workout plan.  For the 2004-05 fiscal year, the plan calls for $9 billion in permanent spending cuts and programs saving $6 billion in loans and deferrals.  We will see some fee increases such as for higher education, but new broad-based taxes are not in the plan.  So far the 122 of 238\f",
      "governor’s proposal has received more positive than negative feedback.  The independent legislative analyst’s office called the plan a solid first step.  The state comptroller, a Democrat, and several members of the legislature from both parties have stated that they will work with the governor to craft a final agreement.  That said, significant hurdles to enacting a budget remain.  A formidable group of lawmakers wants to raise taxes, and several of the governor’s proposed spending cuts and spending deferrals may not withstand legal challenges.  One example is the proposal to reduce fees for MediCal doctors.  Some of the governor’s revenue hopes also may not be realized.  He wants to get a larger share of revenue from tribal gaming, but the U.S. Department of the Interior probably will not cooperate since it has blocked similar contracts in recent years.   Turning to the national outlook, recent data on spending confirm that economic activity is on a path of robust growth.  We expect GDP to grow about 5 percent this year and about 4¼ percent next year.  This forecast assumes that policy remains on hold until the fourth quarter of this year and then tightens gradually until the funds rate reaches 2½ percent by the end of 2005.  Under this scenario, resource utilization would rise over the next two years, and the unemployment rate would fall to about 5¼ percent by the end of this year and to 5 percent by the end of 2005.  Here I must admit that the unusual behavior of payroll employment and labor force participation raises questions about the amount of labor slack going forward.   The latest data on core inflation have come in very low indeed.  These data together with earlier revisions imply that the core PCE price index rose hardly at all over the past year after adjusting for bias.  In response, we have lowered our forecast of inflation, and we now expect core PCE inflation to come in at 1 percent this year and slightly above 1 percent next year.  The new data also raise the possibility that inflation will decline further to uncomfortably low levels.  123 of 238\f",
      "Although the probabilities of upward and downward movements in inflation may be balanced, the cost of a bit higher inflation appears smaller than the cost of a bit lower inflation.  To me, the inflation and employment data argue strongly for leaving policy unchanged despite the strong growth in real GDP.  Further, some long-run simulations carried out by my staff suggest that a policy of leaving the funds rate at 1 percent through the end of this year leads to unemployment and inflation paths that are virtually indistinguishable from those generated under the optimal policy, assuming an inflation goal of somewhere between 1 and 2 percent.

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic picture unfolding in our region, like that for the nation, continues to be encouraging.  Both the hard data and the accompanying commentary from merchants confirm that holiday sales were quite positive.  We continue to see a changing mix of fortunes among traditional retailers, specialty retailers, discounters, and Internet shopping sites.  Combined holiday sales exceeded last year’s by almost all accounts.  The news from our important tourism industry continues to improve, with reports of record-breaking attendance for some District attractions and stronger hotel occupancy and bookings.  Single-family residential housing markets in our region remain strong; and even in the depressed multifamily residential and commercial property sectors, vacancy rates seem to have peaked and are beginning to improve.   Business sentiment has decidedly improved across a wide range of business executives that I have talked with.  That optimism and strong profits are being reflected in capital spending and capital spending plans.  Interestingly, that spending is no longer just for cost savings opportunities or for equipment replacement; I am also hearing more reports of spending to expand capacity in selected cases because sales are strong.  Trucking firms, in particular, have noted a significant turnaround in both hiring and truck orders.  Our bank examiners report that large regional banks are seeing a measurable pickup in commercial loan demand, although that renewed activity is still more in the discussion stage than in actual loans booked.  Negative reports are now coming mostly from struggling manufacturing industries such as petrochemicals and apparel.   The area of greatest risk and uncertainty in our regional picture over the near term is employment.  While our region continues to lead the nation in employment growth, we have seen some falloff in the pace of that growth since the last meeting.  That said, the two states that 130 of 238\f",
      "account for the lion’s share of the growth we are getting, Georgia and Florida, now have unemployment rates of only 4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.  The largest employment gains remain in employment services, and not surprisingly the job category showing net job losses continues to be nondurables manufacturing.  At the national level, I think we have to be rather pleased with the trends we are seeing and expect to see in the composition of growth.  I interpret the vast majority of recent high-frequency data to be very positive.  To my mind, perhaps the most important reading since our last meeting is the confirmation of strong business profits and improved business confidence, which are now clearly translating into more investment spending and inventory rebuilding.  That, in turn, should eventually contribute to some better job growth.  Like many others who have already spoken, I see the extent and timing of job growth as probably the greatest short-term risk to our forecast.  In fact, our own forecast is on the low side of the Greenbook and other forecasts. We are less sure that hiring will be as robust as others are expecting.  The greatest longer-term risk, in my view, is the large and growing fiscal imbalance.  The better federal fiscal picture was an important contributor to our economic successes in the 1990s, supporting our ability to conduct monetary policy geared to controlling inflation.  Fiscal imbalance, should it continue or worsen, may significantly complicate our longer-term policy choices.  Overall, my near-term outlook does not differ greatly from that in the Greenbook, and the differences hold little significance for short-term policy, which I believe is about right for now.

      "MR. BERNANKE.  Seventeen forecasts and one guess!  One of the key issues in the forecast, of course, is the role of the output gap, and I have a few comments to make about that topic.  The use of the output gap or the Phillips curve relationship in forecasting inflation was a subject at our two-day meeting in June 2002.  At that meeting, Art Rolnick of the Minneapolis Fed presented research by Andrew Atkeson and Lee Ohanian suggesting that output gap measures were no better forecasters of inflation than a simple random walk assumption that inflation next year will equal inflation this year.  In particular, Atkeson and Ohanian showed that the Greenbook forecast of inflation, which makes heavy use of the output gap concept, did no better than the random walk model for the period 1984 to 1996. Given our current reliance on the output gap concept for projecting inflation, I thought it would be worthwhile to revisit this discussion briefly.  In particular, I would like to call your attention to recent work by staff members at the Board and at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  Work by Board staff member Deb Lindner summarized in a memo last summer, which I’m sure she’d be glad to make available, confirms the results regarding the accuracy of Greenbook forecasts for the period 1984 to 1996 for inflation measured by the GDP deflator.  However, she also shows that the Atkeson–Ohanian results regarding the accuracy of Greenbook forecasts are highly fragile on a number of dimensions, notably with respect to the sample period employed and the measure of inflation used.  Using the GDP deflator to measure inflation and using real time data only, Lindner shows that when the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period is extended back to 1980, the Greenbook forecasts are 40 percent better in terms of root mean squared errors than the random walk alternative.  In the more recent 1997-2002 period—for which we, of course, have the Greenbook data but they are not yet publicly available—Greenbook forecasts of GDP deflator inflation are 35 percent better than the random walk 162 of 238\f",
      "benchmark.  Lindner shows that the results are more dramatic still when inflation is measured by the core CPI rather than by the GDP deflator.  Even for the Atkeson–Ohanian sample period, 1984 to 1996, Greenbook forecasts for core CPI inflation are 24 percent better than the random walk alternative.  For the recent period, 1997-2002, real-time Greenbook forecasts of core CPI inflation are a full 61 percent better than the random walk.  These results are consistent with those of several published papers, including a well-known paper by Christina and David Romer that showed that the Greenbook forecasts of inflation have outperformed private-sector forecasts. The other recent study to which I’d like to call your attention is an article by Boston Fed economists Michelle Barnes and Giovanni Olivei in the most recent New England Economic Review.  Barnes and Olivei estimate a piecewise (linear) Phillips curve that allows the effect of the output gap on inflation to vary depending on how far away the economy is from potential.  They find little relationship between unemployment and inflation in a region close to full employment but a robust relationship when the unemployment rate is relatively far—which they define as 1.4 percentage points—away from the natural rate.  Barnes and Olivei propose economic interpretations of this finding, but I would suggest a measurement-error interpretation.  Because our measures of the NAIRU are necessarily quite noisy, when the output gap is small, the measurement noise dominates the signal.  Only when the measured output gap is relatively large can we be reasonably sure that an actual output gap exists and, therefore, that inflation will respond.  These results, by the way, are consistent with my own informal investigations of the predictive power of the Phillips curve.  For the period from 1960 to the present, I find that a very simple Phillips curve specification does not out-predict the random walk out of sample except at times when unemployment is at least 1 percentage point above its average for the previous six 163 of 238\f",
      "years.  In short, output-gap-based forecasts of inflation are probably the most reliable during periods of recession.  And indeed, inflation behaved as the output gap theory would suggest in 2002 and 2003.  Looking forward to 2004, the unemployment rate is now less than 1 percentage point away from the estimated value of the NAIRU and from its recent average.  While a continuing output gap may induce some further disinflation, from a statistical point of view the random walk model may now be just as good.  That is, following President Stern, a good guess is that inflation in 2004 will be the same as in 2003.    With your permission, I’d like to add one thought on the “considerable period” language that we’ll be discussing later.  A good rule of thumb is to try to look as if you know what you’re doing even if you’re not entirely sure.  We properly emphasized that “considerable period” refers to economic time, not calendar time, and we made our commitment explicitly conditional on low inflation and resource slack.  We can debate whether or not the intermeeting data, including the dimensions.  However, the bond markets clearly believe that they do not, as yields have fallen significantly and the expected date of Fed tightening has been pushed further into the future.  Hence, as our conditionality is not perceived to have been satisfied, we have no fig leaf for dropping the “considerable period” language today.  I would rather wait until March and the presumption that we will see at least one good payroll number by then.  In short, I’m looking now more at long-term credibility issues rather than short-term flexibility and tactical issues.  Of course, if we don’t see a strong payroll number by March, then we might be glad that we didn’t drop the language.  Thank you. \n",

      "MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My comments coming at the end of our go-around are going to be repetitive of some of the views expressed earlier.  So let me just summarize my views.  First, I agree with many of the comments around the table that this recovery has moved into a new phase.  We’ve moved from the stage of the business cycle where the economy was driven mainly by the consumer to one where business is now doing its share in fostering the expansion.  Having more-balanced growth going forward gives me much more confidence that this recovery has legs, and I want to focus my comments on the business side today. We all know that this was a unique kind of cycle because it was driven more by the business side than the consumer side.  While consumer spending continued to grow through the whole recession, business fixed investment and inventory investment both fell and were the major engines for the slowdown that we saw.  On the inventory side, we have now gone from a period, including the first three quarters of 2003, of falling inventories to a period where we expect inventories to have grown in the fourth quarter of last year and our forecast has strong inventory growth going forward.  We’re beginning to see in surveys that businesses are becoming more comfortable with inventory levels.  Now, I fully expect that inventory–sales ratios will continue to push the envelope lower, as business firms continue to improve the procurement and management of their resources.  But I think businesses are beginning to express some confidence that sales levels are sustainable and companies are at least beginning to increase inventories to support the level of sales that they see coming. On the capital spending side, equipment and software expenditures also have turned around in this last period.  Again, in the early part of this recession, we saw consumer spending outpacing equipment and software spending.  But in the second half of 2003, we began to see a 165 of 238\f",
      "pickup in the pace of the latter.  There was some growth in that sector in the second half of 2002, but it really wasn’t until after the Iraqi war that we saw some force in its expansion.  And as the survey that accompanied the Beige Book showed—and other surveys reinforce this—businesses now are beginning to plan for increased equipment spending in the coming year.  The other side of the business investment picture that is particularly strong is the business debt picture.  While households have not done a whole lot to mend their balance sheets and they continue to run high debt levels, businesses clearly have made substantial progress.  The flow of funds data show with regard to the financing gap in the last two quarters that cash flow due to strong profitability more than covers the capital expenditures that businesses have undertaken.  This should provide further legs to support the business fixed investment that would keep this recovery on more balanced ground.  So again, I think financial conditions give us strong hope.   As many other members have pointed out, the one part of this balanced recovery that is stretching our ability to understand is the employment story because the data are giving mixed signals.  While the payroll numbers continue to show very disappointing results in light of how fast and how durable spending has been, I believe that it’s due to productivity and that we are in the early stages of improving business confidence that will bring people back to work.  But I also am looking a little more at other indications of improving employment conditions, namely some of the data that come from other sources, particularly self-employed income.  Over the last year, the incomes of people who are self-employed have grown by 50 percent more than the growth in overall personal income.  It may not be so much a formal business expansion as this self-employment income that is creating multiple legs for the recovery and showing up in the household but not the establishment survey.   166 of 238\f",
      "The profitability of major businesses could be forcing up nonfarm proprietors’ income for the same reasons, or it could be that more people—either out of necessity because they’ve been laid off in corporate restructurings or because of lifestyle choices—are choosing to be self-employed.  So, we may have a different type of labor force going forward.  I think we’ll have to wait for more data to see what the end result is going to be.  Either way, I think this shows that small businesses tend to lead employment growth.   \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I ended my previous presentation by saying that I would be very cautious about moving from the very accommodative stance we currently have.  Rates are extremely low and obviously much lower than they have to be over the long run.  But from a risk-management perspective, as you like to say, I think they are at an appropriate level right now.  I think that keeping them low and moving aggressively if necessary makes sense in a situation in which the risks on productivity, costs, and prices are still pointed down.  Total inflation is likely to fall.  We haven’t seen any closing of the output gap.  This is a situation in which we ought to be taking our risks on the side of ensuring a rapid return to full employment. The benefits in economic welfare would be considerable.  A small overshoot that pushed inflation up a little would have essentially no cost and might even be desirable.   Having said that, however, I still support dropping the “considerable period” language and substituting “patience.”  The “considerable period” phrase was inserted as a form of unconventional policy when we were concerned about deflation and the lower nominal bound.  That’s not an issue anymore.  Rates will rise when we move to “patience,” but the expansion is robust to a modest increase in rates.  I think the rise will be modest since it is in the context of weak employment and low inflation.  No one should anticipate that the Committee is contemplating an early tightening.  I think retaining the slight downward tilt in the inflation risk sentence will help, and I believe that is your proposal as well. There will never be a good time to eliminate the “considerable period” phrase.  But I think that doing so today will be seen as a logical extension of what we did last time in terms of tying policy actions to economic developments and to the words that you and other members have used in speeches rather than as a sign of immediate action.  You will have an opportunity in your testimony to expand on “patience” and that theme.  Such a shift is not only about restoring 179 of 238\f",
      "our flexibility; with the economy strong, it might be a good time to let the market react more to incoming data.  There are upside risks to our forecasts and to the path of rates despite the fact that my best guess is that rates won’t have to rise for a while.  Sitting on expectations in these circumstances might not be stabilizing from the long-run perspective.  This could damp some of the interest rate risk-taking that we see in the market.  I’m not sure it will do much about credit risk, which people also have expressed concern about.  I think the lack of appreciation of credit risk is a function of a very, very good economic outlook, and I hope that view doesn’t change even with this change in wording.  I would be cautious about using that argument.  It strikes me that it’s about second-guessing asset-price levels.  It’s something we didn’t do in the stock little cautious about using monetary policy to try to damp asset-price movements.   \n",

That consider to be a fairly optimistic view on the growth of potential output, the level of productivity is above its long-run trend.  This pattern looks to us like standard cyclical behavior.  What we have is a deceleration in productivity as it goes from above trend back toward trend.  That results in a slowdown in the growth of productivity and accounts for the step-up in payroll employment that we believe will occur.  Again, that looks to us to be consistent with the cyclical time series performance of productivity around a spline function type trend, which is basically the way we put together the longer-run productivity forecast.  So as many of you have noted over the past year or so, that forecast incorporates a significant element of risk.  It certainly has been an area where we have been wrong and wrong rather consistently in one direction over this particular period—that is, in anticipating that some of what we perceive to be cyclical increases in productivity are going to abate going forward.  As I think I responded to President Minehan at the last meeting, we really just don’t have a lot to go on in terms of gauging how much of a backlog of one-time efficiency improvements still exists out there.  So in writing down these figures in our forecast, we are trying to blend some judgment and some econometrics.  But this is indeed an area where our confidence is not terribly high. \n",

We tend to believe that firms in their pricing behavior try to look through cyclical movements.  So the implicit acceleration in unit labor costs that is incorporated in this projection does not exert much upward pressure on inflation. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth District has continued to expand since our last meeting, and business contacts remain relatively optimistic about the rest of this year.  Consumer spending and tourism have remained solid through the ski season and into this period.  Housing activity has eased somewhat, as is true elsewhere, but it generally remains strong in our region.  Manufacturing activity also continues to strengthen, as production, new orders, and employment all have risen.  In other positive news, manufacturing firms reported a further increase in capital spending and in spending plans.  And business leaders express optimism about economic growth over the rest of this year throughout our region, with stronger feelings in the eastern part—in Kansas City and that area—and a little less optimism in the Denver area. Commercial real estate has remained weak, and most firms continue to show less enthusiasm for new hiring than for capital spending.  There seems to be a sense that the cost of capital is less than the cost of labor and that, therefore, it makes sense to go with the capital spending.  I’ll give you one piece of anecdotal data in support of that.  Located in our region is a major distributor of propane across the United States.  They have used new technology—call center, global positioning, and communications technology—to move their product from starting point to distribution point.  Using this technology, they are anticipating, to begin with, a reduction of at least 10 percent of their drivers and, longer run, as much as 25 percent because of the improvements in moving out their product.  They came to the conclusion that investing in this technology produced a much greater return on capital than continuing to operate in the old way.  I think that’s part of what we continue to see in the job market.  Let me also mention that we are hearing more anecdotal reports of delays in the ability to bring orders forward.  When firms order goods to be used in manufacturing, they are experiencing longer delays in receiving 49 of 107\f",
      "those goods.  So in that sense the environment is fairly strong in terms of our experience with economic growth. At the national level, activity continues strong.  Our projection in comparison to the Greenbook forecast has no major differences.  On average, for 2004-05 we’re in the same range of about 4½ percent GDP growth.  What I would say to you here—although I’m not advocating any immediate change in our policy stance—is that I think conditions are developing that could allow future price pressures to emerge.  First of all, both monetary policy and fiscal policy, as everyone knows, have been delivering quite a bit of stimulus.  As one person said, “There’s a lot of yeast in this dough, and it’s moving.” I would also say that the anecdotal reports suggest that we are going to see more delays in deliveries—barring shocks, obviously.  And there is more talk of passing on price increases; that is becoming much more prevalent than it was just two or three months ago, or actually even a month ago.  So I’m wondering, in terms of positioning ourselves in the sense of our ability to move rates up, if being tied to developments in the job market is really in our longer-run best interest.  We may have to be alert to this emerging situation as capital spending continues to bring us greater productivity increases.  Despite some views to the contrary, I think that inflationary pressures may emerge before the job market turns around.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. OLSON.  In preparation for this meeting, I focused again on business C&I loans, and for the first time in the two-and-a-half years that I have been following that information source, we are starting to see some measurable growth.  It would be one thing simply to report that, but it’s quite another, at least in my mind, to go back and think about how long it has taken for us to get here.  When I first began looking at these numbers, business loans were in a decline.  From a decline and a sense of very negative feedback, they went to no new information and then to early indications of some bottom fishing and options taking.  After that there was some talk of activity but no measurable activity and then some activity but it was still not showing up in the C&I numbers.  Finally it is in the C&I numbers.  In addition, we have gone from a time when banks and the securities industry were clearly cutting back on marketing and on their parameters for loan approvals to a point where they’ve become very aggressive.  So, I think in a real sense this measure reflects not only the underlying economy but to a certain extent the psychology.  And as Presidents McTeer and Moskow have indicated, there are indications that both have picked up.  So if one were to use the trend in C&I loans as a barometer, it would seem to reinforce the Greenbook analysis of the strength in the underlying economy, with the lag in employment growth being the anomaly.  We made a significant shift in our communication six weeks ago when we moved away from the “considerable period” language and expressed the need for patience.  It seems to me that patience is still in order in our communication at this time. \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It will come as a surprise to no one that I have at least a mild preference for staying with the inflation risk toward the downside.  In my mind, we haven’t yet actually seen evidence—we have a lot of anecdotes but no real evidence—that inflation has even stabilized.  It is true that core PCE has moved up, though from extremely low levels.  But the core CPI continues to decelerate even on a three-month basis.  So I’d prefer to be more certain that actual inflation has stopped falling before I can be convinced that the outlook calls for moving to balance on the inflation risks. My second point is that I think we all expect total inflation to decline relative to last year.  At least the FOMC members projected inflation of 1 to 1¼ percent this year, which is about ½ point less than it was in 2003.  Now, a lot of that reflects a projected decline in energy prices, and perhaps it’s not unwelcome, but the total is expected to fall. And finally, from my perspective, in a risk-management sense, any decline in inflation from current levels—if it’s more than a tenth or so—is more unwelcome than any increase.  I think inflation is at such a low level that a decline has more welfare costs potentially over time than a rise.  I don’t expect much to happen, but in my cost–benefit analysis, the downside risks get a little more weight than the upside risks. \n",

I’ll begin with the directive wording, which is at the bottom of page 11 in the Bluebook: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.”  Moving on to the risk assessment, which is part of the formal vote, that would be the language under “B” on page 12: “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.  With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.” \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The balance of risks has changed since our last meeting, and the changes seem largely favorable.  The outlook for growth seems stronger, with less downside risk.  Inflation risks appear more balanced around a higher but still quite moderate path. The economy of the Second District has continued to improve.  The pace of the expansion has increased.  Where we were weaker earlier in the year, we are now stronger.  There is less caution in the commentary.  Employment is increasing quite rapidly, and businesses report plans to increase hiring further in the months ahead.  We hear, as do others, lots of reports about skills mismatches and difficulty in filling positions.  Inflation in our region is higher than the national average—about double—despite what seem to be higher levels of resource slack and a later onset of recovery.  Much of the rise in prices is due to housing, but business contacts in the District report higher input prices and a greater ability to pass on these costs, on goods at least. For the nation, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 4½ percent this year even if monetary policy follows the path now reflected in market interest rates.  The fundamentals of an improving labor market, moderate compensation growth, and high reported confidence levels seem likely to support a reasonably strong pace of growth in consumer spending.  Investment spending seems likely to continue its rapid recent pace, supported by greater confidence in demand growth, strong profit margins, and favorable financial positions.  In contrast to the picture at some points over the last few months, it’s hard to find evidence of actual or incipient softness in demand.  Although we forecast continued strong productivity growth, we expect the pace to moderate and employment to expand at a rate somewhat above estimates of the underlying rate of growth in the workforce.  Overall, we continue to support a balanced risk assessment on growth, with a path only moderately above what we consider to be potential.    52 of 112\f",
      "The inflation outlook has changed more significantly.  The acceleration in inflation suggests a more broad-based shift than simply the transitory effects of large changes in a few components of the index.  Surveys of establishments show a more generalized increase in the ability to pass on cost increases.  Unit labor costs seem likely to have shifted into positive territory in the first quarter—a significant swing, even if the overall rate of increase seems only modestly positive.  The TIPS spreads show a significant rise in inflation expectations over the medium term and a very modest rise—one could even say by some measures a small decline—over the longer term.  These developments do not, in our view, portend a significant risk of sustained acceleration in inflation in the near term to levels inconsistent with our objective of price stability.  We still believe that the size of profit margins, the degree of slack remaining in the labor market, the fading effect of the decline of the dollar, the recent surge in commodity and energy prices, and the pressures of competition will work to contain the degree of acceleration in core consumer prices. Our forecast is for the core PCE to increase roughly 1½ percent in 2004.  We are less confident in that forecast, however, given the uncertainty we face about the path of productivity growth, the size of the output gap, and the relationship between output and inflation in this environment of transition.  These developments alter the monetary policy calculation. We need to be more attentive now to the risk that a sustained increase in prices could materialize at an earlier point than had seemed likely, and we can afford, of course, to be less concerned with the risk of an unwelcome fall in the rate of inflation.  The risks of being late compared with the risks of moving too early are now more symmetric.  We need to adjust our statement accordingly, to position us to be ready to act soon if the numbers confirm the recent trend toward stronger employment growth. The financial markets seem to reflect a high degree of confidence in our capacity to contain the risks of a significant acceleration of inflation.

Like President Minehan, I’d be concerned that, if we just dropped the last sentence, the markets would overreact if not immediately then over the intermeeting period.  As data come in, they’d start to build in a 1994-type tightening, which is what I think they’re looking for and what a lot of the discussion is about in the markets.  My personal view—or at least my best guess—is that we won’t need to tighten like that.  Inflation is lower, and I think the output gap is disappearing but is disappearing slowly.  So not signaling the markets that expectations of a 1994-type tightening would be the wrong—and  allowing those wrong expectations to get built into the markets—would give us, I think, more trouble than dealing with this word “measured.”  So I believe that we need some way of indicating that our best guess is that the firming, when it comes, will be gradual.   I thought the reaction to your testimony, Mr. Chairman, was perfect because you dropped “patience,” everybody noticed it, and rates reacted a little but not a lot.  And you balanced that by providing a somewhat more detailed outlook.  You said that you didn’t expect inflation to rise and you talked about the downside risk that you discussed earlier.  Well, we’re not doing that here; we’re not giving a detailed outlook in our statement.  So I think the suggestion of a moderate and measured pace of tightening is a way of substituting for a detailed forecast in an effort to moderate the market’s reaction to our statement.

There is the sense not just that an adjustment between the consumption of foreign-produced goods and the consumption of domestic goods is involved but also that there would be a switch in the nature of goods, with a move toward fewer investment goods and perhaps more final consumption goods.  As you’ve looked at this—particularly you, Karen—have you thought very much about what the implications would be for the U.S. economy before we get to the disorderly type of situation—in an even less benign case than described in the list of implications in exhibit 4?  I suspect one of them would be less investment and potentially slower productivity growth here over the long term.

The one stumbling block in trying to analyze this problem that we’ve encountered since we began—we have a little cottage industry here, and I have been doing this for eight or nine years of my life now—is that we don’t have the capacity to relate exchange rates, in real time or hypothetically in a model, to a number of variables and have a deterministic relationship among those variables and exchange rates that works very well at all.  So we are always forced to pose the problem and structure the answer in ways that don’t require that we claim that we can forecast exchange rate developments.  We talk about relationships, but we don’t say that the dollar will do this at a certain point in time or even that the dollar will do this in response to the current account, which is an open issue that we didn’t even raise here.  We have lots in here about how the dollar affects the deficit implicitly.  In Joe’s simulation, the dollar is driving these things.  We don’t really have anything about how the deficit is feeding back on the dollar because being able to explain determination of exchange rates is the weakest link in international economics going.  We don’t have an answer, and others don’t have one either.  I’m inclined to think that, if Secretary Snow rented out Yankee Stadium and made the announcement you indicated, the dollar would move.

Regional employment grew for the third consecutive month in May, bringing the region’s job count even with its year-ago level.  Only in Massachusetts has the employment level continued to be below that of a year ago.  Similarly, the unemployment rate in the region, while bouncing from month to month, is well below both its high and the comparable data for the nation as a whole.  Consumer confidence has been off of late, possibly reflecting lower wage gains in the region than nationally, and spending is growing more slowly than elsewhere as well.  Quite possibly both of these will pick up as the employment situation continues to brighten.  In that regard, business confidence is good.  Business spending is reported to be solid.  Merchandise exports have been growing strongly.  And the stock indexes that Bloomberg does for the region have outperformed their national counterparts.  Even the fiscal picture for state government is brightening, with revenue growth above budget for the first half of fiscal year 2004, though structural deficits and prospective funding challenges remain.  Anecdotally, most contacts report strengthening in current business conditions and in their outlook for the future—moving, as one said, from cautious optimism to more optimism than caution.  Most of our contacts, including members of our New England Advisory Council and attendees at recent economic forums we’ve held, reported increases in sales, orders, or revenues in the first quarter of the year.  Virtually all of them also mentioned input cost increases, including for steel, oil and oil-related products, and transportation and delivery costs.  President Poole might want to inform his contacts at UPS and FedEx that, at least among small businesses in New England, there is a revolt building because of the high cost and service restrictions related to FedEx and UPS package deliveries.  One gift and specialty manufacturer, whose peak periods include Valentine’s   95 of 203\f",
      "Day and Mother’s Day, was surprised to find her next-day volume capped on the day before those holidays.  Not a good thing for a business that she says is built on love and guilt.  [Laughter]  Despite these and other rising costs, even smaller firms report that they have more pricing power and are able to pass on cost increases.  Even in the highly competitive world of supplying car manufacturers, price increases related to steel and oil costs were passed on, and those increases stuck.  Finding sufficiently capable labor even for entry-level positions has become a problem as well.  In particular in the hospitality industry, the limits on H-2B visas are a serious problem for seasonal firms.  A lack of labor supply continues to encourage, if not inspire, the search for productivity improvements at firms large and small. In sum, the situation is better in New England now than at any time since late 2001 and there seems to be little reason to suspect that the pace of overall progress will diminish much, at least over the next year or year and a half.  New England has lagged the United States a bit in the recovery, but I expect it will catch up this summer or later in the year. Looking at the national data and thinking about the worries at this time last year, one can only marvel at how fast things can change from job loss to job growth, from policy-induced to what looks like self-sustaining demand, and from worries about deflation to real concerns about inflation.  Incoming data suggest that both consumer and business demand are solid, and the pace of hiring has surpassed expectations.  The rest of the world is growing, and fiscal policy is likely to remain expansionary this year.  Assuming curtailment of the investment tax credit next year, fiscal policy will be less expansionary.  But who knows about continued spending on the military or otherwise? Boston’s forecasts for the next year and a half don’t differ much from those of the Greenbook when done using similar funds rate assumptions.  That is, we see what one could view as a near perfect combination of quite solid growth, continued strong productivity trends, slowly   96 of 203\f",
      "falling unemployment, and rates of inflation that moderate after the pickup in the first half of ’04.  This forecast is shaped by the assessment of slack remaining in the economy and the belief that growth will not be constrained by resources for some time, perhaps not until year-end 2005.  Thus, broad-based inflationary pressures—not just those associated with what is seen as a temporary blip in oil prices—should not be an issue.  Under both Boston’s and the Board’s staff forecasts, policy should begin to tighten but can move up slowly to a level below that of market expectations by the end of 2005.   However, I think this forecast outcome is about as good as it gets.  Even if it is the most likely outcome, the risks around it seem to me to be substantial and appear to be weighted on the upside, at least to the extent that such risks don’t involve unpredictable geopolitical events.  That is, it is hard for me to feel particularly confident about a sizable remaining output gap when inflation data for both the first and second quarters, whether measured by the CPI or PCE and whether looked at overall or on the basis of core estimates, show a substantial uptick.  The best guess may be that this sharp upturn is temporary, but two things about inflation seem undebatable:  It has flattened, and its near- to medium-term trajectory is up.  Just as the speed of the pickup in employment has been a surprise this year, so too could we be surprised on the upside by inflation.  The Greenbook alternatives capture this in the higher inflation expectations scenario, but I suspect that some combination of stronger demand, less room to grow, and rising inflation expectations could work together to produce an outcome more negative than that alternative.  That’s perhaps not a high probability event, but it’s one that does concern me. In that regard, I think the time has come to start moving the fed funds rate up and to get real short-term rates first to a positive position and then to a more neutral level.  The markets expect this. If we don’t start doing it, I think the yield curve probably will steepen with a rise in the inflation   97 of 203\f",
      "premium.  Moreover, I also think it’s time to remove from our statement any characterization of how we will act in the future.  Let’s say what we are doing, why we are doing it, and comment on the risks, but let’s not make any implied commitments about the pace of our actions going forward.  The risks are real.  We may or may not want to characterize them as mostly one-sided but we ought to reserve the capability to deal with them as we see fit when, and if, they materialize. \n",

      "MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic growth is increasingly becoming broad- based and, I believe, sustainable.  Capital expenditures, whose curtailment was the cause of the last recession, are strong.  Employment growth in the last several months has really come back to life.  And manufacturing is showing real strength for the first time, with rising capacity utilization and employment growth for four consecutive months.  Retail sales continue to grow solidly.  And inventories, while increasing, continue to be well managed by companies as inventory–sales ratios drop to new lows every month, which should, in turn, support expansion going forward. Corporate profits are up over 31 percent in the last year, and forecasts are for continued strong growth in 2004.  Debt–equity ratios for nonfinancial corporations continue to improve from their peaks set in the third quarter of 2002 and are now down to levels last seen in the 1970s.  Our recent flow of funds data for 2004:Q1 show a fourth straight quarter of a surplus funding gap for businesses.  Thus, companies have the financial strength to fund continued expansion internally and to access capital markets and financial institutions for funds on favorable terms. Earlier, the Chairman made a comment about the profit share of GDP versus GNP, and the staff—Steve in particular—won’t be amazed that that is one of the numbers I tend to look at over time.  The profit share of the GDP number actually shows a more extreme peak in profit share.  It hit a seventy-five-year high of 8½ percent of GDP in the first quarter, and that’s about 2½ points above the long-run average.  Profit share does tend to revert to the mean over time.  But what does that imply right now?  We know that analysts looking at individual companies forecast that earnings per share for 2005 will show a marked slowdown but still growth.  And they are assuming that companies will have to absorb more costs that are not passed through to customers into 2005. Historically, most profit margin reduction comes through relatively faster growth of labor costs than prices, and that is reflected in part in the recent revisions we’ve seen in employee   134 of 203\f",
      "compensation costs in the fourth quarter of ’03 and the first quarter of this year.  Productivity growth slows as the expansion progresses, and competition for workers intensifies as strong employment growth continues.  Those factors and increased compensation to retain the best employees in more-competitive labor markets will all likely contribute to a larger share of income going to labor.  So I am less optimistic on labor costs than the staff forecast. The various inflation measures released since the last FOMC meeting showed surprising strength.  One of the few indicators to improve, the core crude component of the producers’ price index, has now fallen for two months, but that’s after nine months of exceptional increases.  The core CPI eased a bit in May after three months of acceleration. While one can point to unusual jumps in prices for items such as used cars, apparel, or lodging, the list of these exceptions is getting broad enough to ask whether pricing power has returned in a much wider sense.  So I think this is a time when we need to be especially attentive to the incoming inflation data and make sure we act promptly to limit further acceleration. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent?  If not, let me start off by noting that recent commentary—not only the anecdotal discussions around this table but also the reports from our various Beige Book contacts, directors, and the like—have all pointed to an extraordinarily expansive economy and to the emergence of underlying inflationary pressures.  On the other hand, when we look at the basic data for the recent period, we see a series of downward revisions.  This kind of disparity usually is not found in the same set of information unless we seasonally adjust the anecdotes, and I’m not quite sure how one goes about doing that!  With regard to the data, the latest revisions for GDP and new orders have been down, initial claims have definitely stopped declining, and this morning we learned that the latest data on purchase originations from the Mortgage Bankers Association fell fairly significantly.  There is something very interesting going on, and in time we will figure out what it is.  I am sure that our favorite ex-member of the Board of Governors, in addition to his three rules that were mentioned earlier, has a fourth rule that will suggest how that is done.   I think that the surprises, strangely enough, are not in measures of inflation.  The big surprise is in profit margins. They have surged at a pace we haven’t seen in more than twenty years. The arithmetic of profit margins tells us something very interesting.  At the level of about 12 percent for nonfinancial corporations on a consolidated basis, the arithmetic essentially indicates that a 1 percentage point increase in profit margins over a one-year time frame elevates the rate of inflation by 1 percentage point if unit costs are flat.  And, indeed, if profit margins were to increase by 1 percentage point per quarter when overall unit costs are flat, we would end up with an additional 4 percentage points of inflation.  In fact, starting in 2003, profit margins rose, on average, close to 1 percentage point per quarter; fortunately, this was partly offset by a drop in overall labor and nonlabor unit costs.  Looking at the monthly patterns that are implicit in the income data for this   144 of 203\f",
      "year, it appears that profit margins have been essentially unchanged thus far through the month of and price increases that do not reflect further significant increases in margins.   Profit margins, as has been pointed out, are at the upper edge of the range beyond which historically they have not tended to rise.  The reason is largely that, if they were to rise further, the result would be to contravene the long-term stability of the ratio of profits to national income.  Indeed, what we are beginning to see, I suspect, is an effort to harvest these very large profit and capital, the effect of which is to cause unit costs to move up.  The way that apparently is occurring at this stage is largely through the effects on productivity, as we were discussing earlier. The compensation of employees does not appear to have accelerated materially, although it is unclear what the last couple of months are showing.  It is fairly evident that the real issue does not relate to structural productivity growth but to actual growth.  What the data for April and May are suggesting is a very significant slowing in productivity and, indeed, a marked pickup in unit labor costs.  Unit nonlabor costs actually, if anything, are reflecting a general decline in fixed costs as the economy’s expansion spreads fixed costs over a wider base.  So, what we are observing through the first five months of the year may be the beginning of a shift from the falling overall unit costs observed last year to a pickup largely because actual productivity growth, which was growing at a pace well above that of structural productivity, has moderated.  We are moving from the behavior of inflation as wholly the consequence of rising productivity, and therefore rising profit margins to increasing evidence of stabilizing margins, with some evidence that the stabilization is being induced by some slowing in productivity growth.  In turn, unit labor costs are beginning to move up.  It now looks as though increases in unit labor costs   145 of 203\f",
      "are somewhat above 2 percent, maybe between 2.5 and 3 percent at an annual rate in the most recent month or two. Incidentally, the underlying inflation rate, using the market-based core PCE measure, is at an annual rate of 2.1 percent for April and May, and for the latest three months it goes up to 2.4 percent.  So core PCE seems to have moved into a channel that appears to be slightly above a 2 percent annual rate, but that is in the context of still very high profit margins, which could very readily begin to decline and bring the inflation rate down.   It is difficult to judge at this stage how to play this; but it is very obvious, looking at the data, that what we are interpreting as cost pass-through is essentially an increase in profit margins. The reason is that, if final prices remain unchanged and costs increase, that is another way of saying that the cost pass-through does not exist and profit margins contract.  On the other hand, if there is a full cost pass-through, of necessity final prices must rise as profit margins remain intact.  Therefore, profit margins are probably a good indicator on a consolidated basis of the degree of cost pass-through, which we have seen happening at a fairly pronounced rate.  As I said before, we’ve had profit margins rising at the fastest pace in twenty years, and that’s another way of saying that we have moved from a price discounting environment to one of full pricing power.  Remember, it’s competition that enforces the tendency of real wages eventually to parallel productivity growth.  If that is the case, algebraically we are talking about a constant share of profits to national income in the long run.   Our major outlook problem at this stage gets to the issue of trying to estimate total unit costs and more specifically, on a consolidated basis, unit labor costs.  The latter, as you know, compose two-thirds or more of consolidated costs. Here we have a very interesting set of numbers.  We know, as some have commented, that average hourly earnings have really been quite contained and,   146 of 203\f",
      "indeed, are running below 2 percent at an annual rate.  Wages and salaries per hour that are implicit in the personal income data are running significantly higher.  And I have the data here if I can only find them in my usual well-organized filing system.  [Pause]  I have them now.  The table with these data was sitting where it was supposed to be, and therefore I couldn't find it! In the first quarter, wages and salaries per hour were rising at a 3⅓ percent annual rate and were increasing at a somewhat higher pace in the April–May period. What that tells us is that the average hourly earnings of supervisory workers, which are not published separately, must be rising fairly significantly or, alternatively, the way we usually term it is that the skilled–lesser skilled differential is continuing to open up in the wage market.  Another way of putting this is that average hourly wages of college graduates are rising faster than those of lesser educated workers.  Now, this obviously raises questions about the meaningfulness of the aggregate unemployment rate as it affects this total system.  As far as I can see, there does not appear to be anything in the monthly data that suggests that overall wages and salaries per hour are accelerating in any material way.  Obviously, our analysis is running into other labor income and supplements that are somewhat stronger, but the problem at this stage does not appear to be an acceleration in wages.  The basic problem is an apparent slowdown in productivity that is creating the possibility of increased unit costs that will either affect profit margins or get passed through into higher prices. All that said, the data as best I can judge them at this stage appear to be consistent with flat profit margins and units costs that are rising at an annual rate in the area of, say, 2½ percent, or alternatively with gradually declining profit margins, which is what one would expect in this environment.  That would bring the core inflation rate down to a level of about 2 percent with no real evidence of acceleration going farther out.   147 of 203\f",
      "Without getting into the details of the data we have constructed for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations, if we consider the impact of oil, obviously we can see fairly significant increases in unit costs stemming from higher energy costs.  Incidentally, when we perform this type of consolidation, we also see that unit import costs are rising and then flattening out.  In any event, gasoline prices are coming down quite considerably.  One of the reasons is that margins both at refineries and at marketing operations are running well in excess of what one would ordinarily expect, given the refinery acquisition cost of crude oil.  In fact, the data point to an excess margin of something like 20 cents a gallon, and if that comes down, it will have the effect of damping inflation psychology.   I might reiterate what has been pointed out previously, namely that measures of long-term inflation expectations are remarkably contained.  Indeed, the measure that I find most useful in that regard is the forward rate on one-year maturities nine years out. In other words, it’s the yield associated with the last one-year tranche of a ten-year note.  That yield has barely moved.  Well, actually it has moved; it has moved down in recent days and is now definitely below its level in effect that market participants think the Fed is behind the curve.  If markets thought that, we would see some very significant acceleration in inflation expectations and increases in interest rates.  But there are no real indications in the data that markets perceive us to be behind the curve.  The question is what we should do to make sure that continues to be the case.  For one thing, I think we have to remember that how we move forward is a function of how we evaluate balance sheets in the economy.  If everybody held one-day paper on the asset side of their balance sheet and overnight maturities on the liability side, then whatever we wanted to do would have zero effect on the balance sheets and the income statements.  That is a critical issue of the financial sector.  But   148 of 203\f",
      "because such a maturity structure does not generally exist, we have to be careful not to move too fast and risk destabilizing the financial system by enforcing maturity mismatches and other idiosyncrasies in the financial system.   Remember, while the carry trades have come down and unwound to a significant extent, as Vincent has pointed out, so long as the markets perceive that we will move only on the dates of our scheduled meetings, we can be absolutely assured that tomorrow the carry trade will come back for six weeks because one leg of the carry is thought to be guaranteed.  So, in effect there is no way we can create market expectations that put us in a position of having zero effect at the end of the day when we eventually move.   So where we are at this stage in my view is clearly that we are going to move, or I hope we’re going to move, 25 basis points today.  We have to leave open the possibility that we may wish to move 50 basis points in August.  Even so, I would suggest that our post-meeting statement retain the notion that our further removal of policy accommodation will be at a pace that “is likely to be measured.”  But I also think it would be wise on our part to follow that sentence with a new sentence that essentially nullifies it but doesn’t eliminate it.  That sentence would say, “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects, as needed, to fulfill its obligations to maintain price stability.”   If we decide to go ahead in that way, we will leave open the possibility of dropping both sentences at our next meeting and then dealing strictly with the issue, as Vincent pointed out, of the balance of risks statements.  I’m not saying that we need to, or should, but we open up the possibility.  I would be very concerned were we to drop the word “measured” this time largely because the markets have adjusted to it.  They are in fact behaving as though they know where we’re going today and are in the process of adjusting.  If policy expectations continue to work out   149 of 203\f",
      "that way over time, the market effect will be virtually nonexistent.  Now, that is not going to happen as we certainly know.  Even so, I think we have to be careful not to take any action without significantly foreshadowing what we are going to do one way or another.  We have the forthcoming semiannual testimony to calibrate how we want to be positioned for the August meeting.  And if it turns out in the next three weeks that we have significant acceleration in inflation pressures, I would be prepared to suggest that 25 basis points is not necessarily what we had in mind.  But we don’t need to say that today, and I think it would be a mistake to do so.  I conclude with a recommendation that we move up our target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and that we issue the press statement that Michelle will now circulate.  It refers to the possibility that we may move at a faster pace, but we will do so only if necessary. We need to be cautious because, if we move at a faster pace, we may be taking risks that we do not need to take.  [Pause]  Is that statement acceptable to everybody?  \n",

      "MS. JOHNSON.  Over the intermeeting period, news about foreign economic developments has generally been somewhat disappointing, and we have edged down our outlook for real GDP growth abroad in response.  The downward revision is largest for the third quarter, 0.4 percentage point, as growth appears to have been below our expectations in Japan, Europe, and emerging Asia other than China, where we were surprised on the upside as we were also to a slight extent in Latin America.  For the current quarter and the rest of the forecast period, we have taken an average 0.1 percentage point off the annual rate of foreign growth.  A major factor behind our decision to shave a bit off prospective growth abroad has been the intermeeting behavior of oil prices.  Although the sharp run-up in spot WTI prices attracted much attention, that price significantly retraced its gains in the final two weeks of the period.  However, the far futures price for WTI rose on balance $5 per barrel over the period.  Accordingly, the entire path of oil futures prices shifted up.  To some extent, the elevated WTI prices reflect the premium now being paid for sweet (less sulfurous) crude oil relative to other grades of oil, and we anticipate that this premium will narrow over time as the supply of sweet oil from the Gulf of Mexico is fully restored, refiners shift their capacity, and demand adjusts.  However, consistent with the futures markets, we now project that oil prices will be higher for longer than we thought in September, as continued production at current high rates seems less certain and as demand remains strong.  For the industrial countries, small negative revisions to the outlook were widespread as elevated oil prices have eroded confidence to some extent and weakened domestic demand.  In Canada, an oil exporter, growth has remained strong although we marked down the forecast a bit in response to changes in the U.S. forecast.  For emerging-market economies in Asia, the prospect of sustained, elevated oil prices has more negative consequences than is the case for Latin American countries.  The Asian emerging-market economies generally import oil and other primary commodities.  Higher global prices for these goods plus a somewhat dimmer outlook for the high-tech sector have led us to become less optimistic about these countries, on average.  In contrast, activity so far in 2004 has been strong in Latin America, as primary product exports and energy self-sufficiency—or better—have boosted growth. We nonetheless revised our outlook down slightly in 2005.     We expect that foreign economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter from the slowing that was evident in the preceding three months, particularly in Japan, the United Kingdom, and emerging Asia.  But we look for average growth abroad to weaken a bit over the next two years.  In part, this projection reflects the need for some of the rapidly growing foreign economies, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, to bring growth in line with potential.  Monetary policy has already been tightened in both these countries, and we expect additional moves in Canada.  In addition, we look for growth in China to moderate as officials there use both administrative and interest rate tools to slow credit creation and the expansion of investment spending, in particular.   The subdued outlook for growth abroad also reflects the depreciation of the dollar that occurred over the intermeeting period and the further depreciation that we have  19 of 107\f",
      "again incorporated into the forecast.  Since September, the exchange value of the dollar has fallen sharply against many of the other major currencies.  In response, we have lowered the projected path for the real value of the broad index of the dollar about 2 percent.  Currency appreciation should be a factor restraining growth over the forecast period in the other industrial countries.  In our Greenbook baseline, the combined effect of higher oil prices, the lower dollar, and revisions to output growth here and abroad is a slight easing in the projected drag from real net exports in this quarter and during the next two years.  This quarter and for the first half of 2005 we see the external sector as having a largely neutral effect on GDP growth, as imports are restrained by moderate U.S. growth and exports bounce back.  Thereafter, the negative arithmetic contribution of net exports is about ½ percentage point, as relatively strong U.S. growth boosts real imports while dollar depreciation works to lessen the gap between real exports and real imports.  Nevertheless, the nominal U.S. current account deficit is expected to widen to nearly $890 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, about 6¾ percent of GDP.  This deficit reflects a higher oil import bill throughout the forecast period than previously projected, with the overall trade deficit widening about $60 billion at an annual rate from the current quarter to the end of 2006.  In addition, the deficit on net investment income is projected to widen by a comparable amount as rising U.S. interest rates and the growing stock of U.S. portfolio liabilities combine to overwhelm a modest increase in net receipts from direct investments here and abroad.    This morning, we received data on trade in September.  The trade deficit, at $51.6 billion, was noticeably narrower than we and the market had anticipated.  Contrary to our expectations for a rise, merchandise imports edged down, with most of the surprise concentrated in core goods.  In contrast, exports came in stronger than expected, again with most of the miss in core goods.  Of note, the surprising weakness in exports in August was revised into a respectable gain.  On balance, this morning=s data indicate that real net exports made a negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth of 0.3 percentage point in the third quarter, considerably smaller than the minus 0.7 percentage point in the November Greenbook.  This revision is pretty evenly split between higher exports and lower imports.  Although it is a bit early to draw implications of these data for the current quarter, we remain fairly comfortable with our Greenbook projection.

      "MR. STOCKTON.  Well, I think the employment report would not change our funds rate forecast very much.  One of the things that I tried to highlight in my remarks, though, is that there are a couple of really major pieces of the outlook—such as movements in the exchange value of the dollar and movements in the stock market—where as a matter of joint strategy we are embedding in the forecast a pretty neutral assumption.  For example, the dollar’s path is almost like a random walk, and the stock market will just go up at the risk-adjusted return that one can get in the bond some combination of developments in those areas that, with the kind of funds rate path we’ve written down, could produce more stimulus either because spending will be more interest sensitive or because the transmission of the funds rate into asset markets could be more powerful than we’re assuming in our forecast.   So we write down our funds rate path as sort of a conditioned assumption and, obviously, as developments change, we react to that.  But in your considerations as a policymaker and in thinking about the full range of the risks that you’re confronted with, you might want to ask, Could it be that the setting of the funds rate would produce either considerably more spending or inflation than the staff has incorporated?  I also noted that it’s still the case—and it’s one of the factors that we are struggling with and don’t really have a clear answer to—that we haven’t over the past two years gotten as much activity out of very, very low real interest rates as we would have anticipated.  As I noted in response to a question by President Yellen last time, some of that is apparent in housing and some in business investment also where, even though the growth rates have recovered, the level of spending as a share of GDP looks to us pretty darn depressed relative to the trends that one might have anticipated in response to these low rates.  And in our forecast we’re carrying forward some of that unexplained weakness.  Obviously, if that unexplained weakness were to diminish more 26 of 107\f",

      "MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic situation in the District has changed little since our last meeting.  Activity continues to expand solidly but not exuberantly, closely mirroring the nation.  Housing markets, with only a few exceptions, remain robust.  Consumer spending is solid in both the retail and travel sectors.  Our ports are extremely busy and in some cases are even overburdened because of heightened activity on both the import and the export sides.  One area where there may be softening is manufacturing, as some of our contacts report slower demand growth than earlier in the year.  Finally, job gains remain modest in the District, and unemployment has inched down only slightly.  As a result, labor supply remains ample, and we hear little about worker shortages or accelerating wages. Turning to the national economy, recent data on economic activity have flashed both positive and negative signals, but on balance they suggest that growth is sustainable though trendlike—not nearly as robust as the strength we saw last year.  In spite of the small uptick in the unemployment rate, October’s stunning job growth raises the odds that labor market slack will mitigates the downside risk to consumer spending from muted growth in personal income. The Greenbook forecast, even as revised on Friday, was sobering.  It shows only a meager acceleration in activity next year to a rate that is only modestly above potential, despite continued monetary stimulus and a shallow upward path to the funds rate—shallower than markets now expect.  This forecast seems plausible to me for several reasons.  First, of course, oil prices are surprisingly and persistently high.  Second, fiscal stimulus will turn weaker next year.  Third, there’s a good prospect that the private saving rate will rise from its current low level once housing-price appreciation moderates and the growth in wealth that consumers experience as a consequence starts to taper off.  Fourth, it seems likely that the trade gap will continue to drag down growth, even though the dollar has fallen somewhat since we last met.  And, finally, we do not see business 35 of 107\f",
      "investment in equipment and software rebounding at a sufficiently buoyant pace to propel truly robust, above-trend growth.   The high-tech sector poses risks to the forecast.  As David noted, the Greenbook forecast for IT investment has been revised down rather significantly in the last two rounds in response to disappointing data that showed real growth of only 4¼ percent in the third quarter.  Still, I consider this forecast quite strong.  It anticipates that the share of IT investment out of total equipment investment will rise almost to the level reached at the end of 2000.  I think it’s important to recall that the 2000 peak was bolstered by several special factors, in particular the capital spending binge by telecom service providers and the buildup to Y2K.  In addition, it was propelled by a very rapid pace of diffusion of personal computers and networks, a pace which may prove difficult to maintain much longer.  As Governor Ferguson noted in a recent speech and in his remarks to the Committee last time, the more moderate pace of decline in quality-adjusted computer prices over the last year industry opinion that the pace of the development of software is beginning to slow. On the inflation front, the most recent data have been favorable.  Despite the blip in core CPI inflation in September, it appears that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations are well contained.  The Greenbook forecast for the next year of 1½ percent in core PCE inflation and just under 2 percent in core CPI inflation seems quite reasonable, although there are upside risks from oil and the dollar. Overall, with inflation well contained, output growth that shows no sign of establishing real momentum, and slack still remaining in the economy, I see no reason to presume without further evidence that monetary policy needs to be tightened more rapidly than is assumed in the Greenbook path.  In my view, today’s move will complete the process of removing the insurance premium that was incorporated into the federal funds rate as an emergency measure.  As the Bluebook indicates, 36 of 107\f",
      "the federal funds rate will have returned to a range that is consistent with the prescriptions of a variety of Taylor-type instrument rules.  Future moves in my view should, therefore, be data dependent. If the Greenbook proves accurate, we will have many opportunities to pause in the process of raising the funds rate over the next year or so, especially if the dollar and the price of oil do not show significant declines.  If they do decline significantly, the appropriate path for the funds rate could steepen rather dramatically, but there is little need to anticipate changes in these variables since we can monitor them daily and they take time to play out in the economy.  For today’s meeting, it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25 basis points.  My comfort level with this move was noticeably enhanced by recent employment gains.  But I think the jury is still out on the appropriate move in December, and I believe that we should craft a statement that leaves all options open. \n",

      "MR. FERGUSON.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m having some materials handed out here; and while that’s happening, let me say that I am in broad agreement with the baseline forecast in the Greenbook.  I find it a reasonable basis for making policy judgments at this meeting and going forward.  Having said that, however, I think the risks and uncertainties around the forecast are quite large, and I find them very difficult to reconcile.  High on the list of upside risks is one that Dave Stockton has already highlighted in his presentation, which is that the dollar may continue to depreciate at a pace faster than in the baseline.  Since Dave spent some time in his presentation discussing that, I won’t pursue it in my prepared remarks. While the upside risk from dollar depreciation is clear, the possibility of a more persistent pool of underutilized resources creates a more complex set of risks, and that’s what these charts that are being handed out now address.  Even considering the October employment surprise, the changes in payroll employment have been remarkably subdued during the course of this turnaround.  This observation led me to ask Andy Figura and Bill Wascher to prepare an analysis to explore labor market developments—I don’t know if it explains them—in the recession and postrecession period.  In particular, I was interested in the question of whether this labor market performance is more easily explained by increased productivity or a shortfall of demand.  The first step of the analysis I called for was to identify the industries that have had unusually poor labor market performance since the 2001 business-cycle peak, measuring both absolute net industry employment changes and net industry employment changes relative to changes for a period of comparable length preceding the business-cycle peak. Four industries at the two-digit NAIC level ranked as noticeable underperformers in both absolute and relative terms, and these are highlighted in table 1.  They were durable manufacturing, information, transportation and warehousing, and professional and technical services.  Now, it is 2The materials used by Mr. Ferguson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 68 of 107\f",
      "well understood that one of the unusual features of the recent downturn is the sizable and persistent increase in the share of layoffs that have been permanent.  Job destruction increased during the recession and then fell back, while job creation fell during the recession and has remained low.  The four underperforming industries that I just highlighted more than accounted for the overall increase in the average pace of job destruction between 1998 and 2000 and in the years 2001 and 2002, whereas job creation was more equally spread across industries.  Tables 4.A and 4.B highlight the relative rankings of various industries with regard to job creation and job destruction.  The most interesting question is the following:  Is the slow net job creation, particularly in these four underperforming industries, due to demand shocks, which would be a negative?  Or is it due to supply shocks, which would be a more positive development in these industries?  If you turn now to the next page, chart 5 clearly indicates that there’s a strong positive correlation between changes in value-added share and changes in employment share.  The actual correlation coefficient is 0.77, and it is significant at a 5 percent level.  The four underperforming industries—and here we have divided them up into the three-digit level, and they are designated by the “Rs” on your chart—all tend to be clustered in the lower, left-hand quadrant.  That indicates that these industries experienced losses in both employment and output shares.   On the other hand, if you turn to the next chart, labeled chart 4, you’ll see that there is not a strong relationship between the change in employment share and the change in productivity growth. There’s a mild, very small negative relationship; it’s significant only at the 10 percent level.  And importantly, the underperforming industries are not strongly clustered.  There are a few outliers, which are mostly high-tech service industries.  I must admit, though, that this analysis is somewhat incomplete since we have productivity data only through 2002.  So, based on this analysis of these four underperforming industries, what do I conclude?  First, obviously, the weak labor market performance in this turnaround is more than explained by 69 of 107\f",
      "just a handful of industries.  Second, I tended to conclude that the slow growth of employment in these industries is due mainly to a negative demand shock—and not a positive supply shock—at the industry level.  Negative demand shocks at the level of the industry identified, combined with the slow pace of overall job creation, have led to a large pool of underutilized resources.  So far, so good.  But then the question is, What is the implication for policy?  Here, unfortunately, things get a lot more confusing. Some analysts would interpret this configuration of relative demand shocks as being equivalent to an aggregate negative supply shock—a change in the optimal allocation of labor resources across industries.  Unfortunately, this type of aggregate negative supply shock can be problematic and ambiguous for the outlook for inflation and for monetary policy.  On the one hand, it is possible that the process of reallocating labor resources is particularly sticky and reflects structural changes, which could confront us with some upside risk.  To put it another way, it’s possible that the short-term NAIRU could be somewhat higher than the long-term NAIRU and, therefore, we could be confronting some upside risk of inflation.  On the other side, it could well be that we have a very large pool of underutilized resources that will decrease only very slowly, and that phenomenon is perhaps undermeasured by the unemployment rate.  This is a point that I think Governor Bernanke has made a few times.  And that would cause us to face the possibility of continued downside pressure on inflation as household incomes do not keep up. Now, it’s a little hard at this stage to know which of these risks will prevail.  But I would say, if one looks at the relatively benign performance of unit labor costs and at other signals from the labor markets more generally, that it seems as though we aren’t really confronting the upside risks.  I think we’re more likely confronting the downside risks.  In either case, it seems to me that as we go forward, labor market indicators broadly defined—not just the unemployment rate but also job creation, unit labor costs, and other measures of both resource utilization and cost pressures—70 of 107\f",
      "are likely to be a reasonable sign of economic health and also an important indication of emerging risks.  Therefore, I will continue to repeat the usual statement that Ned Gramlich referred to, which is that I think our policy approach should be heavily influenced by incoming data, with a particular eye on the broad range of labor market developments. Having said all that, I would also note that, like a few others in the room, I recognize that as we go forward we are going to be confronted with the need to take a pause.  I agree with Ned to some degree in that the question of pausing also gives me some pause.  But I’m also certain that as we get new data—and if we’re careful about what we say—the markets will soon come to recognize that their expectations and ours may not be fully aligned.  How this will get resolved, obviously I cannot foresee. But I am really quite comfortable with the relatively modest upward trend in the federal funds rate that is built into both the markets and the Greenbook forecast.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with your recommendations on both the 25 basis point move today and also language that doesn’t hint very much one way or the other about future policy.  There are a couple of other things I’d like to add, though.  One is that I don’t want to forget what exhibit 2 in Vincent’s presentation showed or what President Yellen talked about, which is that, if we move to 2 percent today, we are well up into the range of estimated equilibrium real rates historically.  So while, yes, the rate is low, let’s not get ourselves too wrapped up in the thought that we are outside an acceptable range.  We may be in the low part of it, but we seem to be in the range. Second, obviously having thought about this issue of a slowdown in productivity and in high-tech investments—I’ve talked about it here and publicly—I’d make a couple of other points.  One is that what we do with respect to the possibility of a slowing of productivity growth depends very much on how quickly the market picks it up and it is reflected in asset prices and other things.  If, in fact, the market doesn’t pick this up and if asset prices continue to rise inappropriately, we have to do something to slow aggregate demand down to the new expectation of slower increases in aggregate supply.  On the other hand, if the markets pick it up relatively quickly, asset prices won’t move up as quickly, aggregate demand won’t be out of line, and we still may be in a mode where we want to raise rates for a variety of reasons, but we may not feel as pressed because of the productivity uncertainty you talked about.  So I think in both cases we need to recognize the probable direction, but I at least am still very much open minded, as I think President Poole suggested we should be, about the pace at which we’re going to move in this direction.  In essence, I don’t think that the market necessarily has it wrong, nor do I think that the Greenbook has it wrong either.  So I am very much of a pragmatic view about what our policy stance next year might be. \n",

      "MS. YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation to increase the funds rate 25 basis points, but I am concerned about adopting the proposed statement.  When I opened the Bluebook this time, I was actually pleased to see in alternative B what I thought was a well-crafted statement that hinted at a possible pause in a way that was rather artful and subtle, without foreclosing any option in the future whatsoever.  And I thought the reasoning in the Bluebook in support of “B” was strong and convincing.  As Vincent stated, both before and after the employment report, market participants expected some hint in the statement of a possible pause. After we received the employment report, there was an update to the Bluebook that contained alternative B′ as the proposed statement.  So I took B′ as a response to the employment report, and to my mind that was an unwarranted shift.  I would note that the Greenbook assessment of the appropriate path for the funds rate had not changed as a consequence of the employment report.  But we observed a large and, if the Greenbook is right, excessive market response to the employment report.  We saw that in the immediate move in the fed funds futures.  I suppose if one interprets the employment report as a very strong signal—and perhaps this is the view that you were expressing—that structural productivity growth is lower than we had been assuming, then this B′ statement would be an appropriate response.  But it seems to me that the Greenbook has already incorporated an expected decline in productivity growth.  I suppose in the Greenbook the decline is cyclical not structural, but it is built into the Greenbook forecast.  The employment report simply confirmed what the staff had earlier been expecting when they had been surprised by the low employment growth.  So it seems to me that adopting B′ reinforces the market expectation about the future path of monetary policy in a way that I would not like to see it reinforced.  My own preference would be to move today but to adopt alternative B rather than B′. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I am a firm believer that low and stable inflation is of paramount importance for an economy to have long-term health.  I’ve held that view for a long time, having experienced some of the effects in our region of an inflationary cycle and the washout that comes with that. Let me say that I thought these papers on whether we should adopt an explicit price target were good and very helpful.  As I read through them, I came to the conclusion that there wasn’t, as you said, a lot of evidence suggesting that explicit price objectives have a negative effect and that there was some perhaps weak evidence that they may have helped to anchor long-term inflation expectations.  Based on that, I’d be inclined, depending on how the rest of today’s discussion goes, to support using a range for consumer price inflation as an objective.  Given its general acceptance by the public, I would choose CPI inflation because it’s better known.  And I would have an objective somewhere in the range of 1 to 2 percent or 1½ to 2½ percent.  I also think the horizon should be the medium term and that, therefore, the objective should be total CPI.  If the horizon were short, I would agree with Governor Bernanke that the objective should be stated in terms of the core CPI.  While somewhat vague, I think a medium-term period would provide the information that would be important for anchoring long-term inflation expectations.  I would also monitor very closely core inflation and use it to explain deviations of inflation from the target range.  I think it can be very helpful that way. I also agree with the point that an explicit inflation objective might be perceived as unduly emphasizing one component of our dual mandate, and I think that’s a legitimate concern.  I would think we could avoid this perception by ensuring that we always talk about both objectives in discussing monetary policy strategy and operations—although we can’t put a target on the growth side.  That’s something we need to think about and work through.  But I don’t think it should necessarily inhibit us from going down this path.    20 of 177\f",
      "Finally, let me mention only briefly how we might go about introducing an explicit numerical goal.  I do not think we need congressional approval, but I’m not the expert on that.  I defer on that to someone who is an expert, but I’d prefer not to go that way. I could accept having the Committee vote each year on a medium-term inflation objective.  That would allow us to take into account a changing environment, a changing economy, and changing dynamics.  While this would allow for the possibility that the objective could change, depending on developments, I doubt that we would change it very significantly or often.  I assume that we’d probably reaffirm the previous year’s objective or modify it slightly based on changing circumstances.  And I think having such an objective would serve us well in terms of keeping us focused on a primary goal of long-term price stability.  I’ll stop with that, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  I want to start by commending the staff for the background papers that in my view were quite thorough and balanced. The question today is whether the FOMC should or should not adopt an explicit numerical price-related objective and, if so, how.  My feeling is that this is a rather narrow question as it has been presented to us today in the sense that, given our current practice, announcing such an objective would not require very much change in Fed policymaking.  And yet I think it’s an extraordinarily important step for us to take. Regarding the operational issues raised in the memo by Wilcox and company, I agree with the recommendation that the objective should be a consumer price index—either the CPI with a 2 percent midpoint or the PCE price index with a 1½ percent midpoint.  These midpoints would allow for a known upward measurement bias and provide an additional 1 percent cushion against the zero bound.  My preference would be to target the PCE index since that measure has some  methodological advantages and it’s what we focus on internally.  I also have a preference for targeting the core measure because that would be sufficient to anchor headline inflation over time, but it would afford us the latitude to allow the relative prices of food and energy to fluctuate without necessarily requiring a response.  I would also favor a 1 percentage point range, from 1 to 2 percent, rather than a point target, so as to give us a reasonable safe harbor within which we would not be pressed to explain fluctuations in inflation.  A relatively narrow safe harbor, however, would discipline us to explain why there are fluctuations in inflation and how we expect to reverse them  over time.  And I’d expect that our inflation objective would be revised only infrequently, mainly in response to improvements in measurement. With regard to the issues covered by Vincent’s memo, I think we should announce our objective to the public.  When we do it, we should emphasize that it’s an incremental step and does not imply a dramatic departure from how we have been conducting monetary policy.  We should also emphasize that we believe—based on central banking experience both here and abroad and a priori reasoning, perhaps—that it will enhance the operational power of monetary policy to stabilize    31 of 177\f",
      "both employment and inflation.  And we should explain that it will do so by better anchoring long-term inflation expectations and thus improving our ability to communicate in the short run. Admittedly, monetary policy, as many people have remarked here today, has been working relatively well lately, and we’re already widely credited with making low inflation a priority.  So the question arises of why we should take the additional step now of announcing an explicit long-run inflation objective.  For me the argument boils down to three things.  First, we all agree that we want inflation to remain fairly close to where it is now.  I took that as a consensus, Mr. Chairman, that the costs of failing to keep inflation this low are well understood.  And on net, there are no good reasons to want inflation higher or lower than where it is today. Second, by announcing a specific long-run objective, we would not be giving up much flexibility that we haven’t already given up or that we shouldn’t be happy to give up.  In the process of establishing the reputation that we have now for our commitment to price stability, we already have given up the flexibility to let inflation expectations get out of control.  An announced objective would be meant to guide our actions in the long run.  It would not hinder us, in my view, from taking the kinds of policy actions we take today to stabilize employment and output in the short run. It would help discipline us, however, to undo and to explain how we intend to undo any short-run departures from our long-run objective.  More to the point, it would force us to respond when measures of expected inflation move very much outside our target range.  There are no circumstances, I submit, in which we would want expected inflation outside of a narrow band around our objective for very long.  Thus, the narrow scope of flexibility that’s at stake here is something I think we’d be better off without. Third, establishing an inflation objective within the Committee would facilitate discussion.  And announcing it, I think, would lead to better public understanding of how we intend to conduct monetary policy going forward.  The value of ambiguity about our long-run intentions has outlived its usefulness in my view, and I don’t see any reason to retain that ambiguity.  Moreover, I think better clarity about our long-run objective would help us be more transparent about the short-run    32 of 177\f",

      "MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On your specific question about low and stable inflation, I, too, believe it is very important.  I had similar experiences to those Susan Bies had in private industry in the late ’70s and the ’80s, and I share her views completely. I also had some experiences in government in the late ’60s and early ’70s.  In 1971, when we had wage and price controls, I headed a little group called the Council on Wage and Price Stability, which was monitoring inflation after controls were put in place.  This was a terrible period.  It was bad in private industry, and it was bad in government, too.  We want to do everything we can to avoid going through another period like that or having to face those problems again. In answer to Vincent’s questions, I come out for alternative 1.  Let me explain how I got there, but first I would add my compliments on the staff’s work.  The papers the staff prepared were excellent. In terms of defining price stability, in principle I think behavior does reveal the costs associated with inflation.  In the definition that we’ve all been using, we look at the way people are behaving in terms of devoting resources to dealing with inflation costs and risks.  If behavior suggests that the costs are low, then that is price stability.  That’s the definition we’ve all been using.  This means, of course, that inflation not only needs to be low, it also needs to be stable. So, would it be helpful to define that as a number or a range, beyond the behavioral side?  I guess, in practice, it would be useful within this Committee to have an explicit number to judge where we are and where we’re going.  And to answer Vincent’s questions, if we were to do that, I think we ought to use what is technically the best index, which is the PCE.  It’s less familiar to the public than the CPI, but the more we use it publicly, the more people will catch on to it, and certainly people would learn a lot more about it if it became the focal point of our discussions about inflation.  I tend to focus on the core inflation number, and I personally think that 1½ percent is a reasonable assessment of what might be best.  But I would say that anything between 1 and 2 percent would be about the same for economic performance.  Anything lower and the zero bound becomes an issue.    43 of 177\f",
      "I did want to make a couple of comments about the discussion of a range versus a point estimate for our objective.  We’ve heard arguments on both sides, and I guess I would put in a caveat about a wide range.  People have talked about 1 to 3 percent.  I think we would need some greater clarification about the acceptable outcomes within that range.  For example, let’s say the range was 1 to 3 percent and we had 2¾ percent inflation for four or five years in a row.  I don’t think any of us would really feel comfortable saying that’s price stability.  Janet mentioned that having any range gives the impression of a zone of indifference, and I think that’s an important point.  I share some of her concerns about that, so I think it would be an important issue to address if we ever were to set a In terms of the role of the price objective in the policy process, as I said, at this time I prefer alternative 1, the status quo.  I would augment it with some of the steps that Vincent mentioned in his memo to give more information to the public.  In a sense, this is a further evolution of our efforts to improve transparency.  We’ve taken an incremental approach to improving transparency, and I think it has served us very well.  Going further than those incremental steps I don’t think is Now, the staff paper discussed the international experience, which I found very interesting. But our situation is really quite different from the two groups of countries that were mentioned.  As Cathy noted, we don’t have a crisis to deal with, as was the situation in Brazil or in Mexico.  We have low inflation and a good deal of credibility.  We’re also the largest economy in the world, so the formation of inflation expectations here is likely to proceed differently than it does in smaller economies and ones that are much more open than ours that appear to have benefited from inflation So, I don’t think we’re ready to proceed on this yet.  I believe it would be best to take small steps.  I can see a number of possible problems that could arise.  I think we have to be very careful in discussions with the Congress and with the public over how to address this issue in view of our dual range. necessary. targeting.    44 of 177\f",

      "MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting, I described the economy as being in what I called a mid-cycle sweet spot, so the obvious question is: What has happened since then?  I would say that, in general, my headline is bifurcated.  One is, “so far so good;” and two is, “there are a number of caveats”. Let’s first look at the “so far so good” part of the headline.  As all of you have already pointed out, the economy seems to be gaining momentum.  Households continue to be in good shape.  The saving rate is, unfortunately, low, but that is supporting consumption.  Households are also being supported by an increase in compensation per hour that continues to look quite robust. As the Greenbook has pointed out, there seems to be no pothole on the investment side, so the business fixed investment component is also kicking in.  Nevertheless, as a number of you have already indicated, some concerns have arisen recently on the inflation front.  But I think we should also recognize that long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  And importantly, while a number of costs have gone up, unit labor costs themselves continue to be, if anything, quite moderate.  All of this suggests to me—though I will point out some caveats—that the incoming data are not flashing a signal that we are clearly behind the curve.  So what are the caveats that seem to be important?  Both of them deal with some uncertainties regarding the supply side of the economy.  First, we have a question about what is going on in the labor markets.  As all of you know, several meetings ago, and then at the AEA [American Economic Association], I put forth some relatively rudimentary analysis that suggested  that some of the decline we’ve seen in labor force participation rates may not turn around very quickly.  The staff has done some much more sophisticated analysis and has come to a not too dissimilar conclusion.  So I think we do have an obligation to mark down our expectations of the          61 of 116\f",
      "     that conclusion. increase in labor hours that can go into overall potential GDP.  The staff has done that, and I support The second uncertainty with respect to the supply side has to do with productivity growth. This, I think, will be an ongoing question for us for some time to come.  I recognize—as do others, including President Yellen—and applaud the fact that there appear to be many positive signs with respect to productivity growth.  We had a discussion in this room, for example, in a meeting with the SIA, suggesting that Moore’s Law continues to be in shape, which is obviously a very positive thing.  And we have seen some upside surprises in income and productivity growth, which, again, is a very positive development.  Having said all of that, the staff takes into consideration the net debt financing of financial firms and the financing gap information, both of which show that firms have a great deal of room  left to invest; the staff views those as positive signs that there is some potential upside to productivity.  I would say that we should at least be a little cautious in that assessment because those developments may involve some negative signs.  So I think there’s a little question mark on the capital deepening component of productivity increases.  At this stage, I’m generally willing to support the consensus that has emerged around the table, and in the Greenbook forecast, that productivity probably is in good shape.  But we need to monitor that.  Another caveat has to do with this issue of energy prices.  I, along with Governor Bernanke, realize that energy prices play a relatively small part in inflation in the U.S. economy, particularly against the backdrop of well-contained unit labor costs.  However, like others, I recognize that the increases in oil prices seem to have had a dramatic impact on market psychology and may be the thing that could undermine the relatively well-contained inflation expectations that have been beneficial to us.  So, with regard to oil prices, I’d agree with others that the supply and demand   62 of 116\f",
      "    dynamics are such that not only are oil prices likely to be in a higher range, as indicated by the far-dated futures, but also that the surprises are more likely to be skewed to the upside.  In my view, the recent increases in oil prices reflect some real concerns that world supply will not be able to keep pace with demand growth, as a few of you have already said.  In particular, I think the cushion of spare production capacity has narrowed significantly. In preparation for this meeting, I asked the staff to do an options-derived probability density function of WTI prices.  I don’t have the results to hand out, but when one looks at the December 2005 function, there is a particularly large skew to the right-hand side.  I think this is telling us that there are significant market concerns that prices could surge in the event of supply disruptions.  These concerns have pushed up both futures prices—which to me can be interpreted as a mean expectation for future spot prices—and also spot prices today, reflecting, I think, some heightened precautionary motives for holding inventories.  So there is a real risk that with very low short-run price elasticity of demand, a supply shock could lead to very big moves in price and potentially unhinge the inflation expectations that we have benefited from.  So I think that is another caveat to worry about.  Finally, President Geithner has raised a few times the question of whether or not the predictability of our language has been the source of a reduction in either implied volatilities or spreads over Treasuries.  I had the staff do some basic historical charts to look at this issue.  We first introduced in the Chairman’s congressional testimony in 2003 the notion that we’d keep rates low for a considerable period, and that showed up in our press statement for the first time in August 2003.  Since then, obviously, we’ve gone through other terms such as “patience,” “measured pace,” et cetera.  All of that I think has played to some degree in the reduction of implied volatilities and spreads over Treasuries.  But, in fact, if you look at a chart that shows the movement down in    63 of 116\f",
      "implied volatilities and in the spreads over Treasuries, both started to decline many, many months before our original focus on using the kind of language we’ve been using.  So while I don’t necessarily disagree that there are carry trades and that some real risks have emerged, in my view we should not take too much of the blame for that upon ourselves.  I think a number of market dynamics have driven that, along with predictability and transparency at the Fed. That leads me to the final point: What does all this mean for monetary policy?  First, I would say, at bottom, that I find the baseline outlook to be credible and reasonable.  But it is surrounded by a range of risks that I believe, as do others, are primarily on the upside.  Against that background, it seems prudent to continue to execute our pre-announced strategy.  The economy is growing well and needs less and less stimulus; therefore, continuing to remove our accommodative policy at a measured pace seems to me reasonable. Second, given the stage of the cycle, the skew in the general risk assessment that I outlined, and the need to manage market expectations, I think we should use our statement to signal our awareness that inflation pressures may have picked up.  The incoming data are indicative of that.  If we are wrong on the upside risks, both we and the market will adjust.  On the other hand, if we fail to reflect the existence of these upside risks, we could easily be perceived as being behind the curve, with negative consequences in terms of inflation dynamics and, potentially, our own credibility. Finally, I think the statement, as drafted in the last meeting, clearly links the concept of a measured removal of accommodation with a general sense of the incoming data.  And I believe that gives us the kind of flexibility that we need.  Therefore, I’m not terribly supportive of removing the “measured pace” concept at this stage.  I think we have sufficient flexibility using that phrase, when it is linked to the incoming data, to move more quickly if we had to or to pause if we needed to see          64 of 116\f",

On the broad issues, I think we have to continue to attempt to have in our statement some forward-looking language, as painful as it may be.  I did not support the move toward having the minutes come out earlier as a tradeoff.  I know that was in some people’s minds, but I think in the statement itself some forward-looking language about the economy is useful.  It is sort of modern-day central banking practice, and anything other than that, I think, is a step backward and is likely to have a detrimental impact not only on our credibility but also on the On the word “measured,” as I said earlier, I think that’s conditioned upon the expectation of inflation being relatively well contained.  And if that condition in fact turns out not to be true, then we could move more quickly, and I don’t believe it would be undercutting our commitment, if that’s what it is, to “measured pace.”  To me it would just be a way of interpreting the measured pace. On the process of getting this language out to us earlier, I look forward to seeing how the Secretary manages to do that, and I will attempt to be as constructive and helpful in that process as possible.

First of all, I do want to commend the Board staff and the staff of the Reserve Banks on the special survey.  I thought the information on nonresidential construction was very useful. Here are my questions.  First, is there a way we can reconcile the ECI and the compensation data?  They seem to be further apart than typical.  I don’t know technically whether doing so is possible or the extent to which it’s possible.  Second, you note in the Greenbook, but without any real explanation, that federal tax revenues are coming in extraordinarily strong—stronger than anticipated.  What do we know about why that might be the case?  I would also ask about your expected narrowing of profit margins.  My question is, why?  There are lots and lots of economic incentives for corporate managers to keep those margins high and to expand them if they can.  A lot of people have compensation linked to profits, the stock market, and so forth.  So it seems to me that the economics would say that there’s no reason particularly to expect a reversion.  I gather that your explanation was that it’s sort of outside what we have typically observed and, in a time series sense, you expect it to go back.  But I’m worried about the economics underlying that view.  I think it’s quite important for the inflation outlook because, even if wages are well contained, it could well be that companies will just take price increases whenever they can and enjoy the benefits of the profits.  So I’ll let you deal with those in any way you want. [Laughter] \n",

[Laughter]  I recall in previous meetings that I said that increases would be harder and harder to justify, and I certainly expected that by this time we would have paused, although I do believe that a ¼ point raise is appropriate this time.  Were we to accept alternative A, having conditioned the market to think that we would raise until we are done, it seems to me that we would send a signal that we were done if we did pause at 4¾ percent.  On the other hand, the analysis that suggests that there will be a slowing of the economy has been a compelling argument made in the Greenbook, and therefore the description in sentence 2 seems to me to be accurate.  Were we to raise 50 basis points, it would have to be on the basis of an analysis that is more a gut feeling than an analytical approach.  Therefore, I think that alternative B, the ¼ point, is appropriate. We are at an inflection point.  As I have heard many of you say many times, the inflection point is the most difficult part of the cycle, when the most difficult decisions have to be made.  I think President Hoenig made that point earlier.  The wording that I think is going to attract the most attention is in part 4 when we say “the extent and timing.”  By that wording we are conveying that we are at an inflection point and that we may move away from the every-meeting 25 basis point move, or at least that is how I interpret it.  So I am in favor of alternative B as written. \n",

      "MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B and would like to echo Governor Kroszner with respect to the reference to inflation expectations remaining contained.  In light of where the would be a very loud omission.  I think that alternative likely would not be expected or generate the kind of balanced reaction that we are trying to achieve.  The other emphasis that we have in section 4 addresses what I think is the balance of the discussion that we had today.  I also like in alternative B the reference to the current state of the economy in the first line of part 2, where we say that it has been quite strong so far this year.  This wording provides some credibility to some of the data that the markets are perhaps not as focused on as they should be.   So on balance, I do support alternative B as written and would make only a couple of points.  As we approach our last move, or potentially our last move, with respect to this tightening cycle, it does strike me that the burden of persuasion, if not the burden of proof, rests with us to change course.  I do not think that there is any evidence to this point that we ought to stop or even suggest to the market that a pause is in some way imminent.  We have all largely agreed that the risks of policy error here have increased, and that is why a lot of consistency between the alternative B language and our March FOMC language is perfectly appropriate. As the Vice Chairman referenced in the earlier round, we are trying to express to the markets our view of uncertainty so that they do not take what we say as a guarantee of future results but look at the data in real time as we look at the data rather than look directly just at us.  The balance that has been struck in section 4 does that very well.  Should we get to a pause at some point over the course of the next several meetings, it needs to be preceded by vigilance, which I do see reflected in section 4.  I would conclude only that it is better to leave interest rate expectations higher at this moment until we see some real signs of inflation falling more into that zone of comfort, which President Yellen and others referenced.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let me just talk a bit about the policy option and the statement.  I think we are facing two goals that are difficult to achieve at the same time.  The first one is to respond to some increase in inflation risk and what might be a bit of an inflation scare in the bond markets.  In order to respond to that, we would have to signal that we are willing and able to continue to respond to inflation as it rears its ugly head.  If you like, inflation is the nail, and monetary policy is the hammer.  We do not have to strike the nail, but we have to show that we are not putting down the hammer.  We have to keep it in our hand.  [Laughter]  In that respect, I think it is important that we not signal that there is a definite pause.  I am also disturbed by the response of inflation compensation to those signals.  We need to keep the option open to respond once or even more than once if the inflation data and the economic outlook dictate that response.  I do think that the use of the further policy firming language in part 4, which repeats the March statement, will be viewed as hawkish and will probably have some upward effect on yields. Our second objective is to maximize our flexibility, given the degree of uncertainty that we now face in the economy.  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that an optimal policy can well include pauses for two reasons—perhaps more than two, but here are two.  The first is that we gather information over time; to the extent that we gather useful information and uncertainty is resolved, we can make a better starts and permits, two retail sales figures, and two industrial production figures, just to note some of the data that we will be seeing between now and the next meeting.  So I think it is useful for us to indicate that we will be responding to changes in the outlook and to leave ourselves the flexibility to respond in June according to how the outlook evolves. I am very sensitive to the issue of overshooting.  At least in principle, the correct response is that we look at the outlook, not at the current data.  To the extent that our forecasts incorporate the lagged effects of 99 of 120\f",

The first is, Could we drop number five?  It does reemphasize the broad principle that we respond to changes in economic prospects, but it is a bit redundant given the previous statement.  So that is the first question I am going to ask you.  The second question has to do with inflation expectations.  I think it would be a big mistake to somehow indicate that we thought they were not contained.  First of all, it is not factually correct, as Vincent’s demonstration showed.  Second, it would convey a concern about the state of expectations that is greater than the one we actually have.  What we could do—and I am a little reluctant, but I am open to the suggestion—would be to say in that sentence, “Inflation expectations have risen slightly but remain contained” or something like that.   \n",

Yes, I think one of the interesting points about this period is that very question.  Some of the high-risk assets that had been bid up are where we have the most-pronounced price moves, and that does perhaps suggest that positioning is a bigger part of the story because bond markets were relatively tame not just in the United States but also in other, overseas bond markets.  So something of a risk adjustment seems to have happened.  I think the interesting question is why, but it’s very, very hard to discern that.  I, at least, tended to minimize the effect that uncertainty about monetary policy itself has had in causing the volatility in emerging market equities.

      "MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District is also moderating in the second quarter.  Our pattern is similar to that of the nation, but the District had less acceleration in the first quarter and less deceleration in the second quarter.   Payroll employment growth in our three states is slowing.  The unemployment rate has edged up slightly over the past several months, but the unemployment rate in most of the District’s labor markets is still lower than a year ago.  Our business contacts still report some difficulty in filling open positions, and a quarter of the respondents to a special question in our Business Outlook Survey of Manufacturers say that the increases in wage rates needed to attract new hires this year are higher than they were last year.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but the indexes for new orders and shipments were up noticeably after a one-month slump in May.  Despite this improvement, our manufacturers’ expectations about future activity have deteriorated.  While they still plan to add to payrolls and expand capacity over the next six months, they have moderated these plans since the beginning of the year. At the last meeting, I reported that, in contrast to other Districts, retailers in our region did not express much concern that higher gasoline prices would eat into their sales; that view has changed.  Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what I reported at our last meeting.  Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen, but the acceleration doesn’t appear to be as strong as elsewhere in the nation.  In contrast, residential construction in our three states has been flat this year, and home sales are down.  Thus far the slowing in our region looks to be an orderly process. Unfortunately, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region appear to be increasing at a faster pace than those in the nation as a whole, primarily because of a larger increase in housing costs in 59 of 177\f",
      "the Philadelphia metropolitan area than in the nation.  In addition, our manufacturers report that industrial price pressures have increased in recent months.  Fortunately, we do not see a similar acceleration in labor costs, although the increases we are seeing in the Northeast are somewhat higher than in other parts in the country. In summary, current conditions and the outlook in our region continue to be positive, but the rate of expansion is expected to be somewhat more modest than we’ve seen over the past year.  Price pressures continue to be a concern in our region. Turning to the national front, I would characterize the outlook in a similar way.  Our growth forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s for 2006.  We expect a significant slowing in activity in the second quarter followed by a pickup during the second half of the year to a pace that is slightly below potential.  The slowdown in housing and high gasoline prices contribute to a slowdown in consumer spending, and the lagged effects of rising short-term interest rates and higher oil prices keep real growth slightly below potential. Our forecast for 2007 differs somewhat from the Greenbook.  We see growth in 2007 slightly below that in 2006, whereas the Greenbook sees growth slowing appreciably.  In our view, there has been more underlying strength in the economy.  For example, we attribute more of the second-quarter slowdown to temporary factors.  We are more optimistic than the Greenbook about employment growth.  We see nonfarm payroll growth averaging a good deal more than the Greenbook forecast.  We see unemployment rising to 5.1 percent by the fourth quarter of next year. Our inflation outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook’s partly because we see less slowing of aggregate demand.  We do not see core PCE inflation decelerating next year.  We think the economy has been operating and will continue to operate slightly beyond full employment over the next several quarters and that foreign price competition will ease as the dollar depreciates.  So 60 of 177\f",
      "despite our view that the indirect effects of the sharp rise in energy prices will wane in 2007, we expect core inflation not to decelerate.  We do see some deceleration in 2008, but that is because we built in a slightly higher path for interest rates than that in the Greenbook forecast.  Of course, there are risks to the forecast.  Most of them have been mentioned; but in our view, the risks to growth, even at our higher level of growth, are roughly balanced.  In contrast, the inflation risks are slightly to the upside.  As people have noted, core inflation has accelerated in recent months, and it is above the range I consider consistent with price stability.  Should aggregate demand moderate less than expected, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge.  At this point, I believe that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored, and our forecast is predicated on monetary policy ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise longer-term expectations. This is likely my last meeting, but for sure I’ll be watching carefully as we go forward.  I have confidence that the Committee, along with the new Philadelphia president, will do a good job to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored.  I’d like to thank the Chairman, the participants, and the rest of this staff for how well you have treated me over the past three meetings.  I have to remember that I made the statement in June 2000 that it would be my last meeting, so I say “in the foreseeable future” [laughter] it will be my last meeting.  Thank you very much. \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Growth has moderated, but the economy still seems, to us at least, likely to grow at a reasonably good pace over the forecast period, somewhere in the vicinity of 3 percent.  We expect core inflation to moderate gradually from current levels, declining to around 2 percent in ’07.  This forecast assumes that monetary policy follows a path fairly close to what’s in the market and in the Greenbook. The key difference between our view of the outlook and that of the Greenbook forecast is in the strength of demand growth relative to potential next year.  We have reduced a bit our estimate of potential and also of actual growth, but we still expect the economy to expand at a rate close to potential.  This is a very favorable forecast, and we have to recognize, of course, that the economy is going through a set of extremely complicated transitions, including a large, adverse, sustained relative price shock of uncertain duration and a substantial adjustment in asset prices that is now concentrated in housing.  Our capacity to anticipate the evolution of these forces and to assess their effect on growth and inflation is, of course, very limited.  The forces that now appear to be working on the economy still present the unpleasant combination of upside risk to inflation and downside risk to growth; but for the moment we believe that the former, the possibility that our forecast is too optimistic on inflation, remains the predominant risk. I have a few points on the growth outlook.  The economy has clearly slowed, and the composition of growth within the United States and here relative to the rest of the world has  changed.  These changes were inevitable, and if they continue to occur smoothly, they seem desirable and necessary.  As a share of aggregate demand within the United States, residential investment had to contract and consumption had to slow.  And U.S. domestic demand had to slow relative to domestic demand growth in the rest of the world.  The key issue we face is      56 of 158\f",
      "judging whether we have significantly more weakness ahead of us than we are now expecting.  In our view, most signs at present point to fundamentally healthy economic conditions.  The survey-based measures of confidence are holding up okay.  Real household income growth seems likely to be good going forward.  Businesses have the resources and the motivation to sustain fairly strong rates of investment growth.  Structural productivity growth, even post-revision, still seems strong.  Inventory levels remain relatively thin, and the tentativeness that characterized much of the expansion in terms of investment and hiring should be a source of some comfort.  Global demand is still quite strong, of course, and together these forces will offset part, but not all, of the weakness coming from the adjustment in housing and consumption growth.  The principal risk to this outlook for growth lies in the possibility that households will slow consumption more sharply because of rising energy costs, higher interest rates, greater pessimism about future income gains, or the effect of the housing adjustment on perceived  wealth. Financial markets are showing a little more concern about future growth, but not a lot.  This concern is most evident in the greater inversion in the yield curve that has emerged at the one-year to two-year horizon.  I think you can see in the market some moderation of exuberance in credit markets, but just a little.  Overall, the markets seem to reflect a reasonably favorable view of future growth prospects. On the inflation side, as I said, we expect core inflation to moderate, not quickly and not dramatically but by enough and soon enough to bring core PCE inflation down to just below 2 percent over the next 18 months.  The issue we face is not so much about the acceleration in core inflation that occurred in late 2003 and 2004.  After that acceleration, core inflation was sort  of trendless, in the vicinity of 2 percent for much of the two-year period, until the past six      57 of 158\f",
      "months, when we saw this uptick.  The real problem we face is assessing the extent to which the very recent acceleration in core inflation reflects transitory factors, such as the indirect effects of energy prices, and the extent to which it may reflect pressures from higher resource utilization and other things less benign and less transitory.  Energy pass-through, of course, seems part of it, but probably not all of it.  Shelter doesn’t account for all of it either.  This judgment is critical for us, and we need to be careful that we’re not assuming away the more uncomfortable explanation, such as a broader inflationary impulse or a rise in pricing power that could reflect increasing  acceptance of higher inflation. How confident can we be that the pressures that have induced this rise in core inflation  will moderate sufficiently to bring down the rate of increase in core PCE prices to the vicinity of 2 percent or below?  Reasonably confident, I think.  With the economy growing at or slightly below trend, with growth of unit labor costs peaking and decelerating a bit as the Greenbook forecast anticipates, with inflation expectations moderating at short horizons and pretty stable at longer-run horizons, with energy prices flattening out, and with the dollar falling only a little, this forecast seems reasonable.  But note the number of assumptions and conditions this forecast depends on.  Also, the expected path for inflation implies only a very gradual moderation and a period of sustained inflation above what is presumed to be consistent with this central bank’s long-term preferences.  The risks of this forecast, as I said, still seem to lie on the upside.  It may be some time before we can be confident that the forces are in place to produce the necessary moderation. More generally, however, we face the very difficult consequential challenge of trying to figure out the longer-term consequences of having been in an exceptionally long period of exceptionally low real interest rates—both real short rates and forward rates—that were induced      58 of 158\f",
      "by monetary authorities here and around the world.   Real short rates now look as though they were perhaps lower relative to the estimates of equilibrium even than we thought.  Perhaps more remarkable was the low level of forward real rates during much of our tightening phase.  These financial conditions may have produced more inflation momentum than we thought, and this Those expectations are substantially below the peak in ’04 at the long horizon. However, the rise in asset prices and residential investment and the leverage caused by this long period of very expansionary monetary policy may lead to a process of adjustment in asset prices that could be more sustained and more damaging in terms of confidence and of demand than we expect.  This risk is greater if we end up allowing more inflation than our forecast anticipates, for the required monetary policy response could induce an even sharper adjustment in risk premiums and asset prices.  This possibility argues for a lot of humility in judging the appropriateness of the present stance of monetary policy and what will be appropriate over time, and it argues mostly for having as much flexibility as we can going forward, emphasizing that the inflation risks remain the predominant concern of the Committee.

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I found this a challenging meeting for arriving at a policy conclusion.  I certainly agree with many of you that inflation has been running higher than we want for longer than we have wanted, and I actively debated whether we should continue on our  tightening path.  But in the end, I think there are a number of advantages to keeping policy unchanged but being very careful to talk about the upside risk to inflation that we see.  One of those  advantages is that the staff may actually be right.  [Laughter]  Keeping policy at this rate may be  consistent with a moderation of inflation over coming quarters.  Even if inflation doesn’t moderate quite as fast as some of us might want it to, at least it’s on the right, downward, track.  In my  previous remarks I cited a few things that lead me to think that that’s a nontrivial possibility.  One is  that we have had some evidence that growth is slowing to at least the growth rate of potential and transitory, as Governor Kroszner said, and will lessen over time.  So I think that keeping the policy rate where it is could well be consistent with making progress toward our objectives of stable prices and maximum employment over time.   Because there’s a strong expectation in the market, not 100 percent but around 80 percent, that we won’t do anything, I think that, if we keep policy unchanged but continue to express considerable concern about inflation risk, there will be very little market reaction in terms of the expected interest rates further out on the curve.  That would imply to me that financial conditions won’t be loosened by our keeping policy unchanged.  Talking about inflation risks will also preserve our flexibility for the future.  We’ll let the market know what we’re most worried about, and keeping policy unchanged while talking about inflation risks will give us some of that flexibility, which would be very, very important given the uncertainties.  There are downside risks to growth as well as the risk that inflation will remain higher.  Expressing the concerns about       81 of 158\f",
      "inflation but keeping policy unchanged gets us off what Chairman Bernanke called “the escalator” of 25 basis points a meeting.  The situation is such that it would be a good idea to get off that escalator and have that flexibility without signaling that we think we’re done but just that we’re stopping for today. In terms of the language of the statement, I’m not sure that alternative B fully expresses the  concerns that I heard around the table about inflation risk.  President Moskow raised one of those issues—that the alternative B language has nothing about high levels of resource utilization.  I think high resource utilization is a risk.  One suggestion would be to take the language in alternative C under section 3 and put it in alternative B as perhaps a better expression of what the Committee’s  concerns are, even while keeping policy unchanged.  That would speak to President Moskow’s point.  Another word that was dropped from the announcement was “productivity” as damping inflation.  I think that’s a close call as well.  Productivity growth remains very strong.  The staff has with history.  At the same time, with compensation increasing, labor costs are not really holding down inflation and aren’t expected to hold it down in the future.  So I could go either way in terms  of including a reference to productivity.  To me, deleting it would indicate that the unit labor cost path that we had for holding down inflation, which we cited last time, isn’t there anymore.  But it is a fact that productivity continues to be strong.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With each speaker, this discussion gets more and more interesting.  I think it’s fair to say that anybody who has been involved in the  policymaking process for very long has made a speech or talked publicly about how you come to  the meeting with your own views and you’re always willing to listen to your colleagues and change  your mind.  I come probably as close to that phenomenon today as I have in my ten years at the table. As I listened to the discussion that we had earlier, I guess I was a bit surprised at how great  the concern about inflation is.  I share it certainly to a great extent.  I think that one could, in fact, make a very strong case for a further tightening move today.  It seems to me, however, that a   tightening move today would have to come with an expression of continuing concern about inflation.  That, I think, would imply probably additional tightening moves.  If combined with the notion that we’re not satisfied that the path we’re on will get inflation down well within the range, a tightening move today implies an even greater likelihood of further tightening.  I think that kind of path raises the probability that we’re going to do too much and stay too long at this.  Not to “me too” your comments, but perhaps because I come from the Southeast, where housing is such an    important factor—though I’m not sure I understand completely the slowdown in housing and how  important that may turn out to be—it is certainly a factor in my mind.  I’m willing to give more weight to the optimistic forecast on inflation than it sounds as though some are.  I appreciate the   pricing power discussion that we’ve heard around the table, but we have been hearing that for years,   and I would hope that the same things that kept that from playing out would continue keeping it from playing out. Again, one could, in fact, make a very honorable case for a further tightening move today,  but that’s not where I came in, and that’s not where I end up after the discussion.  I think in some         87 of 158\f",
      "ways that’s a harder conclusion to come to, but I still favor something like alternative B.  It would be very good for us to demonstrate the willingness to pause and try to understand the things that are going on a little better than we do.  I am willing to trust, perhaps more than some are, that the forecast inflation is going to work its way down.  I am less obsessed than some with trying to push it   all the way down to 1½ percent in the very short term.  I don’t think that the world would expect and insist that we do that.  We have enough credibility that we should use a bit of it now to give ourselves time to see  where we are.  If our forecast that things are going to be okay turns out to be wrong, we can change our position rather quickly and regain whatever loss of credibility somebody thinks we may have  incurred.  Again, all things considered, I favor no change in policy today and language similar to what’s in alternative B.  I do not intend to dissent today if the consensus is on the side of tightening, but I have a reasonably strong preference for using this opportunity to take a break in the path we’ve been on and to try to understand a bit better where we are.

      "MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As others are, I am very torn about this our situation.  Part of it is the language that we used in the past. If you look at the first exhibit that we were given, you see that the fed funds rate responded to the second-quarter GDP report and the employment report.  We have told the  utilization matters to us.  It seems to me that the lesson from that is, first, we should come  through with what we told the market we were going to do and, second, we should get some of those things out of the statement because we need to put a lot more emphasis on the inflation risk that we face going forward.  I am particularly unhappy, quite frankly, with leaving the reference to housing in there.  Housing is likely to continue to have some weak numbers, and it seems to me that we don’t want the market to believe that policy is really being driven by one sector of the economy.  I offered some language for section 2.  I think that is a statement about the past—“has moderated from its quite strong pace.”  If you just look at the second-quarter GDP report, there was moderation pretty much across the board.  That was the language I suggested.  I think we  ought not to be referring to housing explicitly.  We should try to move toward a bare bones statement and not create expectations in the of the things that is peculiar about having that in the statement at this point is that the staff is not forecasting any significant gap in resource utilization that would put downward pressure on inflation.  So how can we be referring to resource utilization as our primary reason for thinking        96 of 158\f",
      "that inflation is going to moderate?  It seems to me that there is some internal inconsistency  there. The problem that I have with alternative B, as it is now worded, is this:  If we believe that we will want to increase the target funds rate at our next meeting—which I think is the interpretation of that last section—then we should do it today.  We shouldn’t signal it for the future.  Given that expectations seem to be well contained, I think that we have a chance to use our language to get out from under some of the expectations we have created and that we should come through on the expectations we have already created.  You see that clearly in the way the data dependent, and I think we’d better come through and be data dependent.    I want to say one other thing about housing.  I think that housing may be telling us that it is really a good measure of consumer confidence.  Housing obviously involves people looking forward and deciding what commitments they’re willing to make.  I would interpret housing as being a combination measure of people’s attitudes toward the future, the security of their income flows, and the commitments they’re willing to make—to include obviously not only the households themselves but also the lenders that are responsible for making mortgage decisions.  So I would downplay housing as a direct component of GDP.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  Well, in terms of what we know today, I think we ought to be noncommittal.  If we continue to get information that leads to extending the inflation risk or to that, and we ought to leave ourselves open to be responding to that.  We shouldn’t write ourselves into a box by focusing on resource utilization because those numbers are in many ways the most visible ones to lots of people.  Suppose we get another low number on the August employment report, and we have pointed to resource utilization as one of the things that we’re counting on?  Are we then writing ourselves into a box in terms of the expectations we create by emphasizing resource utilization?  So that’s why I’m arguing for a very, very general and rather vague statement. \n",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  As I said before, obviously this is an extremely difficult decision, and I agree with many people around the table who have said that very respectable arguments could be made on both sides.  So I would say that, on net, there are some advantages to keeping policy unchanged but communicating very, very strongly our wariness about inflation. I think there is value in pausing to see what is going to happen with growth.  Around the table, we certainly expressed different views about what is happening to growth.  We know that we’re likely to continue getting somewhat unfavorable numbers on inflation, but I think the unwelcome and not particularly favorable on inflation, but we haven’t seen inflation expectations become unanchored.  Also, we’ve been seeing that the markets have apparently been assuming that we are not going to move now and that we’re not going to move in the future, if you look to the fed funds futures markets; but that assumption hasn’t manifested itself in any increase in the short-term or longer-term inflation prospects.  That’s very heartening to me.  If that weren’t the case, I would not feel comfortable in moving toward supporting a pause because, as many of us have discussed, the expectational context and credibility are very important.  Credibility is an easy thing to lose and a difficult thing to recapture, but I don’t think having a pause now would lead us to lose credibility.  I think also that it’s important that we see a pause as not being just until the next meeting but as possibly going over multiple meetings because a lot of information, particularly with respect to inflation, will come out over time.  I expressed my view that we may be seeing some transitory effects on inflation that are due primarily to shelter services.  Within two or three meetings we’ll have a better feeling for whether or not those effects are likely to be transitory, and I think keeping our powder dry is very valuable.        105 of 158\f",
      "We’ve been emphasizing not just that we are data dependent but that we are forecast dependent.  What do the data say about what is likely to happen in the future?  Saying that we are forecast dependent helps to underscore that, even though the current data or the recent backward-looking data are not favorable, we are looking to the future to what the evolution of inflation and growth is likely to be—exactly what the last line of alternative B emphasizes.  I think, one, it’s what we should be doing and, two, it’s important for people to see that.  So I would favor going with alternative B or having the language in alternative C.  I’m not sure the alternative C language adds all that much more, given the fairly strong statement that we have in the assessment of risks, because I think that is likely to lead to a somewhat changed expected feds funds futures curve—to leave some probability that we may move and that this is not a stop.  Certainly, if our pausing is interpreted as a stop, we need to pursue a communication strategy to convey that it is not a stop and that a pause does not mean just one meeting but possibly multiple meetings as we are gathering more information, particularly about the transitory versus persistent effects of inflation, and are keeping a very careful eye on the effect of both short-term and long-run inflation expectations. \n",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  I’ll be very brief.  I think a number of the points that Vice Chairman Geithner made are excellent, in particular his emphasizing that we have to think about this as a  package but not as necessarily meaning that we must implement everything at once.  We may want  to see how the pieces are working before we do that, but we do have to have the ultimate goals in mind.  We need to have the whole thing together before we can start moving forward because it  could be quite dangerous to change some aspects of communication policy but then realize that, if we want to do something else different down the line, we’ll have to change them again.  So I think  that approach is exactly the right one.  Also because what we’re doing relates to any changes, we have to think about the dynamics.   We see this now in the persistence of certain words in our statements.  We use the word once, but then do we use it again or do we not use it again?  Individual words take on an incredible amount of   importance.  Now, one way to solve that problem is perhaps to put out more and more words so that each one is diluted. [Laughter]  An awful lot of private-sector resources were devoted to the three-letter word “yet” that came out of one of the statements, when I believe that not a single member of the FOMC even noticed it.  I think that is problematic.  I’m not quite sure of the best way to solve that problem, but I think we have to be very sensitive to that.  On the issue of the one versus the whole, the markets have a very strong perception of coordination among us.  The notion that the Governors are independent and that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents are independent is considered laughable.  When people ask me about that, they say, “Well, doesn’t he tell you what to do?”  I say, “No, no one tells anyone what to do.”  Maybe you’d like to, [laughter] but that’s not how it operates.  Part of that notion is just a perception, and so having people speak at the same time may not be much of a problem.  But the perception is that it’s a coordinated effort rather than a series of individuals who are expressing their views, and I think       145 of 158\f",
      "communicating the extent of our independence or the extent of our coordination is something that  would actually go a long way toward things.  I was one of those academics that Don referred to as putting up those tables and trying to figure out whether we were independent or not, sort of rating  us.  But that is not what we’re supposed to be doing, and I hope my comments will not be taken in that context.  One final remark is that we have to be modest about what we’re trying to do.  Part of this discussion is the way of conveying our uncertainty.  I would close my class on money and banking, and I’ll close my remarks here, by presenting a fantastic New Yorker cartoon.  It relates to the former Chairman and shows someone praying, just before going to bed, about the former Chairman, that he knows what he knows, he knows what he doesn’t know, and he knows the difference.  It’s   important for us to be able to try to convey to the markets that we know what we know, we know  what we don’t know, and we do know the difference. \n",

      "MS. JOHNSON.  Once again I find myself reporting to you that movements in global oil prices are among the developments during the intermeeting period that were factors in our deliberations about the external sector.  Global crude oil spot and futures prices fell further following our September projection but by differing amounts over the maturity spectrum.  When we finalized the current baseline forecast, spot prices and very near term futures prices had moved down more than $4 per barrel; futures contracts that mature at the end of 2007 had recorded price declines of about $2; those maturing at the end of 2008 had price declines of about 50 cents.  Indeed, for contracts maturing beyond 2009, prices actually rose such that the far-dated contract for December 2012 had moved up about $1 per barrel in price.  We adjusted our projection for U.S. oil import prices by amounts similar to these changes in futures prices.  The differential movement in prices implies that, even though prices have moved down all along the path through the forecast period, this path now slopes up more steeply than it previously did.  So our outlook is for oil prices to rise rather sharply over the forecast period, although from a lower starting point than in the September Greenbook.  The reasons for the additional decline in prices during Prudhoe Bay, the absence of any sign of late-season hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and awareness of current high inventory levels.  These inventories are by their very nature transitory; hence, market participants seem to believe that some of the current abundant supply will diminish over time, leaving limited spare production capacity and chronic risks to production in Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere.  Late last week, OPEC announced production cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day as of November 1.  Although the size of actual cuts by individual OPEC suppliers remains to be seen, we judge that significant cuts, albeit not as large as those announced, are needed for prospective demand to be consistent with prices in the futures curve.  Those prices remain elevated—around the levels expected at the start of this year.   We again asked ourselves how the substantial drop in oil prices since their August peak matters for the U.S. economy.  As Dave mentioned, some of the near-term variance in U.S. real GDP growth reflects the path of real imports, including oil imports.  The nominal trade deficit is clearly narrowed as a consequence of lower oil prices.  We expect that the average oil bill in the fourth quarter will show an improvement from the third quarter of $60 billion at an annual rate.  The net trade balance on nominal goods and services will improve by just about the same amount as other trade components experience small, offsetting changes.  As oil prices rise going forward, the nominal value of oil imports should move back up; but for 2007 as a whole, we expect that the total figure will be about the same as the total for this year, followed by a moderate increase in 2008.     With respect to our forecast for exports, we again expect that real exports of goods and services will expand at an annual rate of about 4½ percent through early 2008 and then will accelerate slightly, to about 5 percent, over the second half of 2008.  We see this pace of export growth as reflecting moderately strong growth of trade in both services and merchandise.  These components in turn reflect solid average growth of around 3¼ percent in foreign real GDP.  The projected 11 of 203\f",
      "acceleration in real exports in 2008 reflects a boost from relative prices as U.S. export price inflation moderates.  This projected pace of export growth is somewhat below that observed in recent years, particularly in the first half of this year.  To some extent, the double-digit growth of U.S. real exports early this year reflected rapid real GDP growth abroad at that time.  But our models cannot explain all the strong growth, and a sizable positive residual has emerged in our model.  During the first quarter, exceptionally rapid growth of real GDP was widespread abroad as most industrial countries and many emerging-market economies in both Asia and Latin America recorded particularly robust real expansion.    The rapid growth moved many foreign economies closer to potential and was not sustainable over the long run.  We read recent indicators of activity abroad as generally confirming our expectation that slowing from those very rapid rates would occur through the year.  According to the data, among the industrial countries, Canada and Japan have GDP already decelerating in the second quarter.  In contrast, the pace of expansion strengthened in the euro area; but with further tightening of monetary policy and an increase in the value-added tax in Germany to take effect at the start of next year, our outlook calls for a slowdown in growth there as well.  For the emerging-market economies, the most important news is Chinese third-quarter real GDP growth, announced just after the Greenbook was distributed.  Based on the data and our best estimate of a seasonally adjusted series for the level of Chinese GDP, real growth in China was at an annual rate of about 5½ percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, following two quarters of growth above 12 percent.  These data are only approximate as they are inferred from the annual growth rates published by the Chinese authorities.  However, it does seem clear that the measures implemented by Chinese officials to cool the economy have had some effect.  We are projecting that growth going forward will return to rates between 8 and 8½ percent.  Of course, the band of uncertainty around this forecast is significant.  We judge growth at that pace to be consistent with Chinese potential and acceptable to Chinese officials.  This picture of real output growth abroad is a benign soft landing.  We are projecting slowing that does not overshoot in many foreign economies, including importantly the euro area, Japan, and China.  We believe that domestic demand growth in Canada, Japan, the euro area, and Mexico will continue to sustain their domestic expansions and growth in the global economy and will underlie ongoing moderate strength in U.S. exports.  With respect to the current quarter, trade data for August surprised us with the strength of exports and led us to revise up by more than 2½ percentage points our estimate of the annual rate of growth of real exports in the third quarter.  The surprise was widespread across categories of merchandise trade other than computers and semiconductors and included strong exports to most of our trading partners, with the important exceptions of Canada and Mexico.  With no special stories or specific components of interest, we have projected that real export growth will revert to its historical relationship with foreign output and relative prices.  However, the positive surprise in August reminds us that there is upside risk to our forecast for real exports as well as downside risk should foreign growth slow more than expected.  Real 12 of 203\f",
      "merchandise imports in August came in above our expectation as well.  We have accommodated that surprise in part by reducing real imports projected for the fourth quarter, particularly real oil imports.    All in all, our baseline forecast for the combined contribution of imports and exports to U.S. GDP growth over the forecast period is for a small negative effect during the second half of this year that becomes slightly more negative through the second half of 2008, reaching about 0.4 percentage point as strengthening U.S. real GDP growth boosts import growth above that for exports.  David and I will be happy to answer any questions.      \n",

      "MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My own views are quite consistent with what I expressed five weeks ago and with the central tendency of many of the speakers today—that is, a greater concern about inflation prospects than growth prospects.  So I thought what I’d do is just give you maybe three or four perspectives on market activity in the intermeeting period and suggest to you what conclusions we can draw from them and what conclusions I’d hesitate to draw. First, as we noted at the last meeting, the growth in the equity markets is all about earnings and not about multiples.  As the markets record the eighteenth double-digit quarterly growth rate, with quarterly growth in the third quarter likely to exceed, on an annualized basis, the second quarter, on one level you would see reasons for earnings momentum and for more robustness than the Greenbook shows in the prospect for business fixed investment.  Despite those headlines, I think the Greenbook probably has the general slowdown in business fixed investment and the general slowdown in manufacturing about right.  Again, at some superficial level you would think that these stock prices would be juicing business activity—that animal spirits would be as high as they’ve ever been.  But in fact, what we can say with some confidence is that historical models of cash and profits have done a poor job of indicating what the strength of business demand would be here.  Although business demand has certainly picked up over this cycle, it appears not to have picked up as dramatically as a lot of the data might suggest. So what does that mean?  I think it means that there is generally still conservatism in board rooms, conservatism by CFOs.  Although they have plenty of ammunition in terms of their access to capital markets and their cash balances, we’ll likely see them use that only when it’s clear that the economy has turned.  If this soft landing followed by a gradual acceleration does 63 of 203\f",
      "appear to be the most likely path, I would expect to see these companies put their feet on the accelerator a bit more and make sure that growth gets back to trend relatively quickly.  But the idea that businesses are going to turbo-charge their way through this without hesitation appears to be less likely than the data would suggest. Second, let me turn to the debt markets.  There is a discussion among pundits about a tug of war going on between growth risks and inflation risks.  As I look at the data in the debt landing and a harder landing, under the view that inflation is almost assuredly going to be solved by the central bank or by exogenous factors.  Again, a superficial conclusion would be, boy, the that gives me the greatest pause is that, just as inflation is nowhere on the table in the capital consider to be relatively noisy and perhaps not overly valid, for inflation to become part of the discussion in the debt markets.  That’s something I think we have to prepare for.  I suspect, as I think about the balance of this year, that another round of discussions in the capital markets about an inflation scare is quite possible. The third issue is really one of short-term volatility, which I tend not to overreact to, but I do think this particular case is telling.  Typically, several weeks after a quarter, the markets’ assessment of that quarter’s GDP ends up trending toward truth and ends up without a huge disparity as they get closer to and smarter about the underlying information.  I have no reason to doubt our own staff’s view that third-quarter GDP is likely to come in around 1 percent.  Nonetheless, the markets’ estimates are quite far away from that.  Market estimates have, in fact, trended down, but I’d say the median estimate in the market is still in the high ones, maybe even 64 of 203\f",
      "2 percent.  So the question really is, come Friday, if the headline number posts the way that the staff suggests it will, what the market will say about that.  My own view is that there will then be an immediate rush to judgment probably amplified to the downside in a political season like this.  They will say, “Boy, the economy is really on the wrong track, and the economic landing is a very hard one.”  Whether that judgment dissipates as markets look forward and start to understand the reasons for the shortfall is a bit of a concern.  Also, some in the marketplace may have the view that, if that landing is relatively hard and fast, the pace of economic growth will do our work for us on the inflation front.  Obviously I don’t think that view is shared by many of us around the table; in fact, there might be more work for us to do.  It wouldn’t surprise me if the half of 2007, and I suspect we’ll need to send Don back out there to give them another speech. [Laughter] \n",

I know the focus today is on explicit specification of a numerical definition of price stability.  Certainly in my case, and I’m sure in many of your cases, the interest in that depends a lot on interactions with other elements of the package—for example, projections.  If that’s important to you, I hope that you’ll refer to it because I do think we’ll have to proceed on some of these other Let me conclude by reiterating a point that Governor Kohn made, which is that we will not be making any decisions today.

      "MS. MINEHAN.  Well, it will probably come as no surprise to anybody around this table that I don’t agree with some of the things that have been said, though I have a great deal of respect for the opinions that have been expressed.  I want to go through the questions in a somewhat different order:  first of all, whether or not explicit numerical specification of price stability is helpful; second, whether I think it would affect policy setting; and then third, if we’re going to do it, some beginning thoughts—and they are only beginning thoughts—on how we would do it. Is an explicit numerical specification of price stability helpful?  My answer to the question hasn’t changed much since we last talked about this in February 2005.  I don’t think it is.  Based on the evidence then and the updates since, I don’t believe an explicit numerical specification of price stability would have sufficient benefits to U.S. policymaking to outweigh the potential costs involved in either actually taking our eyes off the other goal of policy or being seen as likely to do so.  There is no doubt that such a specification has been useful in countries with a track record of very high inflation or no central bank credibility.  I think it also was useful in the formation of the ECB, since there was a new central bank with no track record.  In the cases of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, it was part and parcel of their gaining independence, which was important in a number of other ways.  So I don’t think the situation in other countries necessarily applies to the United States, and I don’t think we have a good body of evidence that they’ve done with inflation targets, however they’ve been set, any better than we’ve done over the past whatever relevant time period it is. It is asserted that an inflation target of some sort enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy by helping to generate market expectations and actions that are consistent with the goals of the central bank.  But it’s not clear to me that our current process doesn’t do that about as well as it can be done while leaving some room for the flexibility that I believe is vital to the policy process. 151 of 203\f",
      "Now if we adopted, and we probably are likely to adopt, some form of price stability specification, what does that do to policy setting?  If such a target or goal is to be credible, then time the goal is either met or missed.  But we don’t have just one goal.  We have two goals, and how we react to inflation readings or forecasts will depend importantly on the trajectory we see for economic growth, output gaps, unemployment, however we want to phrase it.  Thus, the setting of an objective for just one of our goals could result in somewhat less transparency about what our policy actions right now might actually be; even worse, having such an objective could result in actually making policy in a way that is insufficiently sensitive to growth. Every paper we have received on this topic has stressed that aspects of setting a so-called flexible inflation goal can reduce the possible cost of confusion about our commitment to dual goals.  Specifically, we could set a wide range.  We could choose a long period over which to attain the target.  We could choose an inflation measure less subject to volatility, particularly over the long run.  We could communicate extensively about all aspects of our forecast, et cetera, et cetera.  But in the end, if everything about the goal is so flexible or needs continual communication, how does it, in fact, deliver its benefits? I really wonder what problem we’re trying to solve.  The communications subcommittee asked for our perspectives on the goals of communication.  I believe we can improve how and what we communicate, but I don’t see that the effort to communicate better by definition has to include an explicit numerical target for inflation.  For the best part of twenty-five years, no matter how we have measured inflation, it has moved down.  GDP has faltered only occasionally, and unemployment has really been the envy of the developed world.  This was done without an explicit inflation target, and I wonder whether one would have helped much.  I also wonder whether we 152 of 203\f",
      "know enough about what the underlying inflation mechanism is within our economy to lead us to certainty about what the correct range is.  Is it zero properly measured, or is some level of inflation, low and stable, actually good for the way the economy functions?  I am not sure I know the answer to that question, which makes me hesitant to put a numerical range around my goal. Finally, we do need to consider the likely interaction with the Congress as we set a target for one of our goals but not another.  In my view, the Congress should be very interested in the short-run tradeoffs between that target and growth in unemployment.  It might be hard, for example, to explain the virtues of a goal that’s focused on a 1½ percent midpoint rather than the current inflation of 2½ percent.  Over the long run, I think either one of these numbers could be consistent with solid growth.  But in the short run, moving from one level to another would require some sacrifice, and I think the long-run charts in the Bluebook show that.  There’s no research I know of that proves a lower rate is clearly preferable, though inflation stability at any low level might be.  So how is the sacrifice justified?  What else might that interaction with the Congress provoke?  The possibility for unintended consequences is clear. Now, I think I’m as committed to being accountable, credible, and transparent as anybody else around this table.  However, I believe that we’ve achieved those goals in spades and that an explicit numerical target has the potential to do some harm.  The possible benefits of setting a numerical target seem to me to lie solely in the advantage to some of being able to point to a number rather than thinking of price stability as the absence of concern about prices in everyday business and consumer activity.  A number conveys precision, but that precision itself could backfire by seeming to require a policy response that may not be optimal.   That probably covers the question about whether a numerical price specification is helpful and the related question 3 about whether the quantification of the long-run objective would serve as 153 of 203\f",
      "a new influence on policy setting.  I think it would serve as a new influence on policy setting.  Frankly, I don’t find it hard to understand where people around this table come from at present or where they have come from over the past thirteen years.  I think that if you set out a numerical target, it will change the dynamic around the table, and I’m not sure in a positive direction. Okay.  I know I am in a small minority.  I know most people see only good or at least nothing bad coming from an explicit specification of price stability.  I know the decision over time is likely to be to pursue such a specification.  If that happens, here’s a general idea of how I think it should be done.  First, I agree with Don and, I think, Rick as well:  One ought to approach this process very carefully.  Once in the public domain, an inflation goal, target, specification, whatever you want to call it, will be there and will be very difficult to take away.  I believe the markets at present think we’re after the lowest feasible level of inflation that we can get consistent with a reasonable level of growth.  Once a number or a range is attached, market perceptions might change in unforeseeable ways.  When or if we take this step, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to reverse it, so we had better be both thoughtful and careful about doing it.  So I like ideas such as Rick’s that there are ways we can evolve to this and we can take some dry runs or intermediate steps that give us a sense of what the longer run might be. Second, I haven’t given a lot of thought to the possibility of each member of the Committee setting his or her own goal, but it is consistent with my understanding of the way the Committee is intended to function, with each of us bringing our own thoughts and frameworks to the table.  Over time, the resulting diversity of perspective is vital to the way the Committee works.  Thus there is some appeal to the direction in which Rick was going, which is, as a first step, disseminating perhaps twice a year or more frequently the range of FOMC participants’ personal definitions of price stability in conjunction with their near-term forecasts.  I wouldn’t extend the forecast.  The 154 of 203\f",
      "difference between the two could well indicate policy concerns even without fully specifying the underlying policy path in the forecast.  I don’t know if that’s where you were headed, Rick, but I see some value in that step as a matter of evolution.  Perhaps a key reason I seem to think more about each participant’s own price stability definition is that it allows for some uncertainty about how the policy discussion will come out.  Maybe unlike others, I see some policy uncertainty as a good thing.  Most of the time we cannot forecast exactly what the Committee will find necessary to do, and I think we should avoid giving the appearance that policy moves are always known months in advance when they aren’t.  Making it clear that nineteen different perspectives and definitions are involved could, I think, contribute to that. Finally, regardless of whether a numerical specification of price stability is set for the Committee as a whole or reflects a range of our individual preferences, the target specification needs to be a range rather than a single number.  I think of it as an umbrella rather than a target.  We should use a measure based on either the headline or the core CPI on the grounds that most people know what that is.  It is part of the life that they live day by day, and so it resonates in our communication.  We should set a medium-run to long-run target of five years or so over which the specification would be met if the relevant range were exceeded.  I think that gives us enough flexibility to deal with crises of one sort or another.  We should do whatever we can to make sure that we, the central bank, and not the Congress, set the target if we’re going to have a target.  That’s as far as I can go. \n",

      "MR. WASCHER.  The top panel of exhibit 5 summarizes our assumptions about the supply side of the economy.  As indicated in line 1, we assume that potential output growth will edge down over the forecast period, from 2.7 percent in 2006 to 2.5 percent in 2008.  This slowing primarily reflects our assumptions about trend hours growth (line 2), which steps down from about ¾ percent last year to ½ percent in 2008 because of a steepening downward trend in the labor force participation rate and a gradual slowing of population growth.  Although we are comfortable with these assumptions—and, indeed, have not made any changes to them in this projection—we do see risks on both sides of our point estimates.  For example, as shown in the middle left panel, many outside forecasters are basing their projections on a significantly higher estimate of potential output—in some cases above 3 percent per year.  We suspect that these differences, at least in part, reflect different views about the underlying trend in the labor force participation rate.  The participation rate and our estimate of its trend are shown in the middle right panel.  As indicated by the black line, labor force participation has risen about ½ percentage point since its trough in early 2005.  Some forecasters appear to have taken this increase as a signal of faster labor force growth going forward.  However, we see it as largely a cyclical response to steady employment growth and a tighter labor market, and we expect it to be reversed in the near future as the pace of hiring slows and the underlying demographic forces show through.  In part, our view reflects the fact that the participation rate tends to rise above its trend when the unemployment rate is low.  Periods in which the unemployment rate was below the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU are denoted by the yellow shaded areas in the chart, and the current gap between the actual participation rate and our estimate of the trend does not appear to be outsized relative to historical norms.  In addition, as shown in the bottom left panel, the increase in the participation rate over the past couple of years has been fueled by a rise in the percentage of individuals who moved directly from out of the labor force to a job; this flow also exhibits noticeable sensitivity to labor market tightness.  That said, some groups have behaved differently than our models would have predicted.  On the one hand, the participation rate of older individuals, shown by the red line in the bottom right panel, has risen steadily for some time, presenting an upside risk to our forecast.  On the other hand, participation among teenagers (the black line) has remained surprisingly low, and there are undoubtedly downside risks to our forecast of an upturn for this segment of the population.  Exhibit 6 describes another source of tension in the recent data that may have implications for our estimate of potential output.  As shown in the top left panel, our standard Okun’s law simulation (the red line) suggests that the unemployment rate (the black line) fell more last year than would have been expected given our current estimate of real GDP growth in 2006.  In the baseline forecast, we assume that an increase in the unemployment rate causes that gap to disappear gradually, an assumption that does not seem unreasonable given that the error in Okun’s law at the end of last year was within the bounds of historical experience.  However, other interpretations are possible as well.  One possibility is that current estimates of real 15 of 255\f",
      "GDP understate economic growth last year.  One piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is shown in the top right panel.  We currently estimate that real gross domestic income rose 4 percent in 2006, about ¾ percentage point more than real GDP.  As shown by the green line in the top left panel, if we replace real GDP growth with our estimate of real GDI growth over the past year and re-run the Okun’s law simulation, the actual unemployment rate in the fourth quarter lines up very closely with its simulated value.    An alternative interpretation of the recent error in Okun’s law is that potential output growth was weaker last year than we have assumed—perhaps because of a downshift in structural productivity growth.  The middle and bottom panels address this possibility.  As shown by the difference between actual productivity growth (the black line in the middle left panel) and a simulation from our standard model (the red line), labor productivity decelerated much more last year than the model would have expected.  As shown in the panel to the right, a purely statistical model based on a Kalman filter would have responded to the incoming data since March of last year by cutting its estimate of structural productivity growth by a full percentage point.  In contrast, because we place less weight on the recent data that have not yet been through an annual revision, we have reduced our own estimate by only 0.6 percentage point.  The bottom panels provide a couple of reasons for our reluctance to lower our estimate of structural productivity growth as much as the statistical model would have lowered it.  First, as shown on the left, labor productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector was quite strong last year.  In part, the better performance of productivity in this sector reflects the fact that its output is measured from the income side of the accounts and thus incorporates the difference between GDI and GDP noted above.  In addition, this component omits some sectors that are notoriously difficult to measure.  Second, as shown on the right, a measure of productivity that excludes the residential construction industry also held up fairly well last year, suggesting that much of the deceleration in nonfarm business productivity may be cyclical.  As shown in the middle panel, all told we expect actual labor productivity growth to step back up to an annual rate of about 2½ percent by the middle of this year as businesses reduce the pace of hiring in lagged response to the slower rate of output growth in recent quarters.    The implications of this forecast for the labor market are shown in the top panels of exhibit 7.  In particular, gains in nonfarm payroll employment—shown by the black line in the top left panel—are projected to slow to about 60,000 per month by the second half of this year.  This pace is somewhat below our estimate of trend employment growth—the red line.  As a result, the unemployment rate—shown in the top right panel—drifts up to just under 5 percent, our estimate of the current level of the NAIRU.  To help gauge whether the estimated gap between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU is sending an appropriate signal about the degree of tightness in the labor market, I have included some other measures of slack in the remaining panels of this exhibit.  As shown in the middle left panel, the job openings rate from the BLS’s JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) rose over the second half of last year to its highest level since early 2001.  Because the job openings rate 16 of 255\f",
      "has such a short history, its equilibrium level is difficult to estimate.  However, we can learn something by combining the openings rate and the unemployment rate to form the Beveridge curve shown to the right.  The curve is estimated using data from the first quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2006, with the openings rate on the vertical axis and the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis.  The relationship between job openings and unemployment appears to have been fairly stable in recent years, which suggests that the NAIRU has not changed materially over that period.  Moreover, the latest data point is in the far upper left portion of the graph—the segment of the curve indicative of a tight labor market.  Two other margins of slack are shown in the lower two panels.  The bottom left shows the percentage of employed persons working part time because of slack work at their firm or because they couldn’t find a full-time job.  This measure has moved down over the past couple of years and is currently below its average level in the second half of 1996—an earlier period when we thought that labor markets were roughly in equilibrium.  Also, as shown to the right, the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing remains a little above its long-run average level.  Exhibit 8 presents the inflation outlook.  Despite our view that labor and product favorable than we were expecting at the time of the last Greenbook.  Perhaps most notably, the recent data on core consumer prices—shown in the top left panel—have been lower than expected.  Core PCE prices were about unchanged in November and, based on the latest CPI reading, we expect an increase of only 0.2 percent in down our estimate of core PCE inflation in the fourth quarter by ½ percentage point, to an annual rate of 2.1 percent.  As shown in the top right panel, the lower path of oil prices led us to revise down our projection of consumer energy prices.  These lower prices directly pull down our forecast for total PCE prices; they also imply somewhat smaller indirect effects from energy costs on core prices over the forecast period.  As shown in the middle left panel, a higher exchange value of the dollar in this forecast led us to reduce the projected path of core nonfuel import prices.  The combination of these various influences led us to shave our projection for core PCE prices—line 4 of the middle right panel—by 0.1 percentage point in both 2007 and 2008, to 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent respectively.  As before, the slight downward trajectory to core inflation reflects our projections of waning indirect effects of the earlier increases in energy and other commodity prices, declining relative import prices, and a  In light of my earlier discussion of the risks to our assumptions about potential output growth, the bottom panels present one alternative simulation from the Greenbook, in which we assume both a higher trend for the labor force participation rate and slower growth in structural productivity.  Specifically, we calibrated the simulation so that overall potential output growth was essentially the same as in the baseline forecast, but with structural productivity growth ½ percentage point weaker and trend hours growth ½ percentage point stronger.  As shown in the bottom left panel, this change to the composition of potential output growth has little effect on 17 of 255\f",
      "aggregate activity and the unemployment rate.  However, the implications for inflation—the middle panel—are noticeable, with core PCE inflation moving up toward 2½ percent next year because of the effects of lower structural productivity growth on trend unit labor costs.

People often talk about China’s reserve accumulation affecting U.S. interest rates, but they are only two countries in a big world and you may think that the United States, Europe, and Japan have relatively open financial markets with a lot of mobility.  If you look at all the industrial countries together and the flows to all of them together, however, maybe there’s less mobility between the industrial countries as a group and the emerging markets as a group.  That might be more believable.  That—along with the fact that these flows are big, even when you distribute them over all the industrial countries—is what makes me think that there may be an effect.  That may raise a doubt in your mind.  It’s not just to the United States or just to Europe; it is in the aggregate. To answer President Stern, it looks to me—and I’ll double check with our experts—as though, according to our forecast, our model would have predicted negative real net exports last year.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The second portion of our meeting is devoted to communications.  President Plosser submitted a memo about external communication that suggested there might be some unease in the Committee.  In the hope of somewhat reducing that unease, I thought I would try to state one more time what I was trying to get at when we discussed this issue before.  Perhaps without taking too much time away from the important discussion we want to have today, if anyone would like to respond to that, I’d be certainly happy to hear. I and a few other people had two concerns about talking in public about our communication issues.  The first was that we would try to avoid interfering with the ongoing discussion and the development of consensus within the Committee.  The second was to try to avoid creating any unnecessary political problems that might complicate the adoption of whatever we decide we’d like to do.  So my recommendation would be to ask yourselves two questions.  The first would be, “Would the remarks that I will give elicit opposition or significant disagreement from other members of the Committee?”  If the answer is “yes,” then by giving those remarks, you risk the possibility that other people might be in some sense compelled to respond, and then we are having the debate in public.  My sense of that is that therefore it would probably not be a great idea to give a speech specifically on the pros and cons of inflation targeting, for example, even if you tried to take a somewhat neutral position because it’s inevitably difficult to take a neutral position.  However, I want to be clear.  I think that it’s perfectly okay for people to talk about broader themes—the importance of low and stable inflation, the importance of credibility, the importance of commitment, and the importance of clear communication.  I see no problem there because those are broad, general issues that I think everyone around the table would agree with and that don’t necessarily speak to the issues that we’re still discussing within the Committee.  The other question I’d suggest you ask is, “Would something that I say today be likely to end up being repeated to the 130 of 255\f",
      "Chairman in congressional testimony.”  [Laughter]  That is a particular concern of mine.  The lesson I would take from it is that, if you do talk about the importance of low and stable inflation, which is certainly a good thing to do, you also make the point that we are, of course, committed to our dual mandate and that one of the principal reasons that we seek price stability is to strengthen the real economy. So those are my thoughts.  I want to reiterate that this is guidance, not regulation.  I ask people just to use their judgment and not to feel constrained about talking about broad issues, particularly issues that would command wide agreement in the Committee, and you certainly don’t have to disavow any previous positions.  If you are pressed too far on an issue, you can certainly always say that the Committee is currently discussing these issues and that we’ll be saying more about this in the future.  Again, I certainly had no intention and have no intention of trying to censor people’s words.  I hope that you will continue to talk about the broad issues of price stability and communication, which are so critical to our function as a central bank.  I don’t want to take a great deal of time from our broader discussion, but if anyone would like to react, certainly this would be the time.  President Lacker. \n",

      "MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I mentioned yesterday, my overall assessment of the economy calls for growth to average somewhat below potential in ’07 and to improve in ’08, and I expect labor markets will remain tight with the unemployment rate staying below 5 percent.  Core inflation is higher than I like.  I see some forces that will help moderate inflation toward 2 percent, but I’m concerned that these will not be strong enough to push inflation below 2 percent within a reasonable time frame.  So while I recognize the downside risk to growth, I still think the inflation situation poses the greater risk; and at this point, the costs of a policy mistake on inflation are greater than those of a mistake on growth.  The weak growth environment does suggest that the short-term equilibrium real interest rate may be lower now; if so, then maintaining the fed funds rate at 5¼ percent may provide a bit more policy restraint and with it somewhat more impetus for reducing inflation.  However, the analysis in the Bluebook suggests that this effect will be minor beyond the near term.  So with the increased uncertainty over the growth outlook since our last meeting, it seems reasonable to continue to hold policy steady while we gather more information.  So I do favor alternative B. Let me make some comments on the language.  I agree with Cathy Minehan’s comment on section 2—of stopping the statement after the phrase “moderate pace over coming quarters.”  Just put a period there.  I agree with everything she said as reasons for taking out the additional language, and I would just add that, as now written, it mentions housing again.  So housing is mentioned twice in that section, and I think it’s unnecessary to add those additional phrases at the end.  The statement comes out much more succinct and focused if we stop it after the phrase “coming quarters.”  On the question about “predominant” versus “principal,” I prefer sticking with “predominant” since it was used before in your testimony.  It would be my guess that the definition is probably the same.  I don’t think that’s what should determine the use.  I just think 91 of 196\f",
      "it’s better if we’re consistent here, so I would have a preference for using the same language that was used in the testimony. On the “additional firming” question that Tom Hoenig raised, I have some sympathy with him on this.  As the Bluebook said, it’s difficult to know how the markets will react to this change.  It’s always tentative how the markets are going to react, but the Bluebook said that now the judgment is more tentative than usual as to how they’ll react to this change in the statement.  I think it will reinforce the market’s anticipation of future policy ease and probably increase expectations of ease.  But having said that, I think the new version does more accurately reflect our views and the views around this table.  So it’s a close call, but on balance I think we ought to make the change, and I would support the language in section 4 as written.  \n",

In regard to the language, I’m not yet a master of the nuances, [laughter] and so I don’t have strong opinions on “predominant” versus “principal.”  Because “predominant” is consistent with the past, it does strike me as being slightly stronger.

      "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It won’t surprise anyone that I believe the Committee should adopt a numerical objective for inflation for reasons that we have discussed at great length over the past several meetings—namely, to clarify our internal deliberations, to clarify the public’s understanding of our objectives, and to enhance our accountability for achieving those objectives.  I just do not see how any useful purpose is served by retaining the discretion to vary our objective from medium-term and longer-term inflation trends. Following Vincent’s outline, I believe our objective should be stated in terms of the broadest available measure of the purchasing power of money.  The best measure we have of the true consumption value of the dollar is the price index for personal consumption expenditures.  I believe that the overall index would be preferable to the core as an objective.  I know I’ve argued in the past for focusing on core PCE; but on reconsideration, I’ve changed my mind.  The various arguments for excluding food and energy are narrow, they’re somewhat technical, and they’re difficult to explain to the public—I should know, I’ve tried.  [Laughter]  The arguments are incomplete as well in the sense of the range of considerations that one has regarding choosing the inflation rate—only some of them tell you to stabilize the core inflation rate.  Reducing uncertainty about the rate of return on the purchasing power of money suggests a broader index and one that is much easier for the public to understand.  Moreover, I don’t think arguments for the core, the way it is constructed now, are likely to be robust to structural changes in the economy, shifts in what prices are sticky, what prices are not, what are market determined and what not, and stochastic properties of various components of inflation.  Granted, the overall index is more variable than the core right now, but fluctuations in the overall index are more transitory than the core as well.  We’re naturally going to factor that variability into our forecasts, our actions, and our communications.  In explaining the transitory influences on the 117 of 196\f",
      "overall index, we can easily refer to the core, if that makes sense, as aiding our judgment about where the overall index is going to go.  The fact that various payment programs like Social Security are indexed to the CPI is, in my mind, of no consequence for this choice.  If we target the PCE price index, it will naturally rise in prominence over time.  No matter which index we use to stabilize, people with income indexed to the CPI are going to be exposed to the risk associated with the measurement error in the CPI.  It doesn’t matter what we target; they still bear that risk. Although I and others have discussed a range of comfort zones in the past, I’m uncomfortable with the ambiguity of presenting only a target range for inflation.  When inflation is above the target range, for example, the public would be unclear about whether we intend to bring inflation back to the center of the zone or whether getting just inside the top of the range would constitute success in our eyes.  I think it makes most sense to specify our objective as a single number but also to provide a range around the objective within which we would generally expect inflation to remain and to provide a sense of how close to our objective we expect to be on average; that would help enhance our accountability. What number should we choose as an objective?  Our inflation mandate specifies price stability.  The biases in our measures of inflation imply that price stability corresponds to something a bit below 1 percent for the overall PCE right now.  The main consideration usually advanced for choosing a number appreciably above price stability is the notion of building in a buffer to reduce the probability of encountering the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.  There seems to be substantial popular confusion about the zero bound and its implications for monetary policy.  But I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that we have all the tools necessary to deal with this problem.  Now, granted, the effectiveness of some of those tools would depend 118 of 196\f",
      "critically on communicating credibly to the public, so the zero bound might present us with some unique communication challenges, should we encounter it.  I can imagine giving such potential challenges some small weight in choosing a target value, but I emphasize small because, as I said, I believe we would have all the tools we need at our disposal, and we ought to be able to communicate that fact. Taking all of this on board, I believe 1 percent would be our best choice for a numerical inflation objective.  I believe 1½ percent would be tolerably close to price stability, but I view 2 percent as incompatible with our price stability mandate.  Should we adopt an objective above 1 percent, however, we should not emphasize the zero bound because doing so would only reinforce the public’s sense of anxiety should the situation ever arise.  I think we should provide the guidance that we expect overall inflation to generally remain within plus or minus 1 percent of our objective.  We should view our choice of objective as close to permanent—this is important.  That is, we should be extremely reluctant to alter our numerical target.  We are inviting people to make long-run plans on the basis of our commitment, and they should be able to count on us over the long haul. A corollary of viewing our choice as permanent is that we should not place any weight at all on current initial conditions and the associated transition costs when choosing what to target.  A universal property of monetary models, and many other models as well, is that initial conditions have no bearing on the long-run inflation rate under optimal policy.  It doesn’t matter where you start; you get to the same optimal inflation rate in the end.  Furthermore, choosing a target closer than otherwise to where we are now in an effort to avoid transition costs would delay and dilute the contribution to our credibility—delay because eventually the inflation rate will change and we will need to take action to return inflation to target, and dilute because 119 of 196\f",
      "choosing a target to match current inflation will encourage the public to believe that if inflation drifts away we might change the target again to avoid short-run transition costs.  After all, a fear of transition costs is exactly what discouraged us from taking sufficient action to stem inflation before 1979.  Moreover, the staff memo by Reifschneider and Tetlow shows how the transition costs can be minimal if we successfully communicate our intentions.   Question 4 is, What’s the time horizon by which the goal should typically be achieved—that is, how long would we expect it to take to get to the target at any point in time and from any state of the world?  Well, this may vary.  I believe that most of the time we should be able to conduct policy so that inflation is expected to return to the objective within two years, assuming that the public understands how we are conducting policy.  An important consideration here is that the credibility of an objective will depend on the public’s ability to assess our adherence to it.  The longer the time that we allow for expected returns to target, the more often shocks will interfere and the public’s inference problem will be that much harder. Question 5 has been reworded.  Should the Committee participants jointly decide on its goal, either through a formal vote or an informal consensus?  You know, if that means striving for broad agreement, yes.  If that means an individual participant should be able to veto an agreement, my answer is no, especially if it’s President Geithner.  [Laughter]  Question 7 is, Should participants’ views be made public in the minutes?  I guess this question has been reworded, too:  How should the public be informed?  If I’m reading this correctly, it refers to how the various views of participants that are expressed during deliberations on establishing a numerical objective be revealed or not.  I see no reason that dissenting views should not be faithfully reflected in the minutes.  But I’m assuming that, once a decision is made, participants 120 of 196\f",
      "are going to accept the agreed-upon goal as the Committee’s objective and the basis for policymaking.   Regarding the trial run, I support doing one in May.  I only have a couple of minor comments.  The first is that I would take the instruction to base projections on “an appropriate path of monetary policy” to mean an appropriate reaction function because I think conditioning on a fixed, time-invariant path for the policy rate doesn’t make much sense and makes it harder to explain what the fan charts are all about.  I would also note that the way in which the simulations underlying the confidence intervals in the fan charts are presented, at least as I interpret them, did not appear to capture parameter uncertainty.  Perhaps other sources of uncertainty as well are omitted.  We should strive to construct those so that they do convey all the sources of uncertainty that we’re capable of incorporating, so they should be comprehensive in that regard.  That concludes my remarks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. LOCKHART.  Having been a president for three weeks, I hope I can still get away with some tentative or preliminary remarks on this subject.  There really are two questions.  The first question is whether or not to go forward, and the second is, if we do go forward, how to implement it.  Regarding the first question, having only today been privy to these discussions, I’m not going to make up my mind quite yet.  But I would like to make a few comments on the “how” side of the question in the event that we do go forward. First, I favor a quantitative price objective.  As to whether it is an explicit objective and whether it has a point goal or a range, I can see pros and cons to both.  The point goal can help in influencing long-term inflation expectations, and an indifference range can be more compatible with the dual mandate.  On balance, I favor a point goal with comfortable bands.  Regarding exact numbers, I’ve not settled on a specific number, but I would think that something in the range of 1½ to 2 percent, depending upon the index that’s chosen, is a reasonable guide to policy and compatible with the dual mandate.  On my preferred price index, I’ve been influenced by the discussion today.  My starting point was core PCE based upon consistency with the past.  I’m more convinced now that an overall measure makes sense because we should be consistent with the pocketbook experience of the public, since we’re communicating to the broad public.  So I would favor one of the overall measures.  I’d like to stress that I am very much in favor of an approach that minimizes the political risk of conflict with the Congress and dilution of the principle of central bank independence.  For this reason I think that an unspecified medium-term time horizon would work best, especially at the initial stage. I believe that flexibility going into this policy is sensible and important.  I’ve thought a bit about how we really ground this decision and ground the specific choices that we make.  In simplistic terms, I would say it should “work”—meaning that the policy should enable the 154 of 196\f",
      "achievement of actual outcomes.  Given the difficulty and the complexity that I’m learning about and the many domestic and international uncertainties, I think we should be flexible enough to have high confidence that we’ll achieve the stated objectives.  Foreign central banks have changed the details of implementation of inflation targeting—such changes have apparently not affected their credibility—and I believe that the FOMC should be able to do the same thing.  Finally, I believe that, for inflation targeting to be effective, its goals should be communicated as a substantial consensus.  I’m making some distinction between the reflection of an actual consensus versus the communication of some degree of unity on the part of the Committee.  Mr. Chairman, let me just end there.

      "MR. LACKER.  Core inflation has come down recently.  But as I mentioned earlier, my sense is that it could well rise again.  In any event, it doesn’t seem likely to fall much further.  So I think we have to position ourselves to do something about inflation when we are more certain that the soft patch is behind us.  I support the actions in alternative B.  I support Vince Reinhart’s language from yesterday.  I am sure there will be more amendments put on the table.  I don’t want to start now by commenting on everything that has been put on the table.  I will just say that, as we recognized at our last meeting, if inflation fell, we would have a problem characterizing inflation, and core PCE inflation has indeed fallen and could well go below that number on Friday, according to the staff.  So it seems appropriate to recognize that improvement.   The difficulty, of course, is how to do so in a way that respects the fact that we haven’t yet decided whether our objective for inflation is 1½ or 2 percent.  This is what motivated my letter to the Committee last week.  I didn’t think the first draft of alternative B was sufficiently agnostic on the question.  My advisers and I put our heads together, and we couldn’t figure out a way to rewrite the statement to acknowledge the my letter I proposed that we go ahead and make a decision by choosing between language consistent with 1½ and language consistent with 2.  After all, we are widely seen to want an inflation rate between 1 and 2, and we communicated that via language in our statement expressing displeasure with inflation below 1 and, more recently, expressing displeasure with inflation above 2. Sure enough, however, some people with far more expertise in the mysterious art of drafting FOMC statements seem to have found a way around this, and the revised 103 of 261\f",
      "statement seems to finesse this pretty well—the language “moderation in inflation has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.”  In other words, we don’t have to say how we feel about 2 percent inflation because we are not really sure that inflation is 2 percent yet.  Now, I think this will finesse the problem for the time being.  Assuming that it does finesse the issue—and that is sort of a big “if”—I don’t think we are likely to be able to finesse this issue forever.  If core inflation does spend some time near 2 percent, as the Greenbook forecasts, then eventually it will become convincingly demonstrated that inflation is indeed 2 percent.  More broadly, the lack of a decision about our objective will continue to pose difficulties both for our statement and our deliberations, and I think it is going to be increasingly unsatisfactory to say we are still thinking about it.  So I hope we can make progress on that soon.  Thank you. \n",

One thing that I worry about and that I hope we can make clear in the minutes—clearly, we couldn’t do it in the statement—is that we have been in an unusual period.  If you look at Greenbook Part 1, the evolution of the staff forecast, the staff forecast for both ’07 and ’08 has changed remarkably little since last September.  There has been a 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 here, but very, very little change.  Ordinarily over this span of time you get some information that changes your outlook in some significant way.  I would hate to see us encourage the market to think that our projected path of 5¼ percent for the fed funds rate is carved in stone.  We need the market to respond to incoming data, as we will have to do when we have some data that really move us off dead center.  So I hope that we would emphasize—and it has sort of drifted into insignificance here—that “future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook.”  I think it is very important that the market understands that.

Uncertainty is critical to they see them in the future.  Everybody talks about the famous Greenspan put.  We know Greenspan is going to be there to save us if the market overdoes it, so let’s just play into the rising market because the Fed will save us if everything tanks.  That is an overdone argument, but I have heard it made.  If we give people a policy path, no matter how we characterize it, they are going to take that as far more a given than we could ever really commit to, and they are going to make bets on that basis.  When those bets don’t work out, it is going to be another version of the Fed leading them down the garden path.  I really think we should not go there.  We should encourage some uncertainty in markets about what our actual policy path is going to be, given that over a three-year period or a three-to-five-year period the range of the Committee’s preferences around inflation is within some narrow band.  Let the markets figure out what they think incoming data prescribe in terms of policy and make their bets on that basis.

      "MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, applaud your putting a concrete proposal on the table.  With a Committee of nineteen, and as many moving parts as this could have, we could end up with a camel when we wanted a horse, and therefore having something concrete to react to is very helpful. Having said that, I have looked at this question both at the strategic level and at the tactical level.  Let me just comment on the strategic level first.  The way I process the question is that it is based on principles in some respect, and some of the principle-based objectives are (1) transparency in governance is a best principle in general, and this moves in that direction; (2) it should enhance accountability; (3) it should enhance public confidence in our credibility; and (4) it should enhance the influence on outcomes—that is to say, it should have a grounding in results and the optimal outcome should involve somewhat less risk.  I am trying to process the thrust of my decisions through that strategic prism.  So I asked myself under what circumstances this could backfire, and I think the answer is perhaps that in periods of very rapid change, volatility, turbulence, severe shocks, and the aftermath of severe shocks, we could find this degree of explicitness and degree of openness problematic.  But I don’t think we can manage to those kinds of contingencies.  I think we have to manage more with a view of normal times. I see here in the Committee some tension, as we address this question, between a mystique model of effectiveness, which perhaps optimizes flexibility and gives us an opportunistic posture and, therefore, is built around closed deliberation and a transparent, explicit, exposed, “out there” model.  They both have some benefits in terms of our ultimate effectiveness.  So I view it as a bit of a balancing act between those two.  But, as 192 of 261\f",
      "I said, I support the thrust because I think the principle of transparency and accountability trumps that of maximum flexibility, if those two things under certain circumstances are opposed.  I am influenced, Mr. Chairman, by your and Don Kohn’s sense that this is incremental.  It is a step and, therefore, is adjustable.  It may not be reversible, but it is at least adjustable, and that means that we can tweak the overall tactical aspects of it to get it to work as efficiently and as effectively as possible. As to some of the specifics, yes, we should proceed.  Four times a year seems right, and I think we have to line it up with the Monetary Policy Reports.  I like the idea of total inflation because I think that is where people live for the most part.  I see the narrative best done as an addendum.  Regarding anonymity, I would say that not being anonymous might be too much disclosure, so I support anonymity.  On the third year, I think of the third year as a statement of intentions.  It is our intended steady state, if we can get there.  I do see a tradeoff there:  Having a single third year is more consistent with accountability, but it puts credibility a bit more at risk.  So as I listen to the debate on that, I am somewhat influenced by Vice Chairman Geithner’s approach of allowing for more flexibility in the outyears.  This is not a moon landing.  We can’t be precise in where it comes out in the thirty-sixth month.  We are in a world of shocks and uncertainty, so I, on balance, favor the idea of buying us some flexibility in the three-to-five-year timeframe.  I like the qualitative characterizations, particularly of uncertainty, for the same reasons.  I am not terribly in favor of accelerating the minutes for now.  We could do that at a later date, after we have refined and nailed down some of the other moving parts here.  I don’t think it buys us enough at this time, so I would view that as a refinement that might be made at a later date.  Let me leave it at that. 193 of 261\n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the statement has been evolving sensibly.  The process is basically working.  I don’t think we need to lock ourselves into any fixed view of the optimal structure of the statement over time.  We should be open to changing it if it suits our purposes in specific circumstances.  Obviously, shaping expectations about the stance of monetary policy is a vital part of what we do.  I’m pragmatic on all the questions about whether or not to have forward-looking language.  There are some circumstances in which it may make sense in the future as it has in the past.  Those should be exceptional circumstances, and using it should be done very carefully and thoughtfully.  But we do not need to commit not to use it.  I also think the basic structure of saying something implicitly about the forecast, the outlook on which our decision is based, is very important.  So we should have something in there that refers to the expected path of output and inflation and the risks to that generally as part of the signal.  Without that, you’d lose a lot of value.  I think I’d still be open to experimenting further as we have been doing with introducing a bit more forward-looking view about the outlook for demand and inflation as part of the statement, even though that will be hard to do well. On governance, I have a very different view.  I think that we really should stay in this governance limbo that we now have.  It’s very important to recognize that we’ve had a huge amount of turnover in this Committee.  It’s important to give the Chairman the flexibility to ultimately be the arbiter of the nuance in the statement without having to go through a process in which he will have to figure out whether he’s prepared to have a vote with significant dissent in that context.  Right now we have a process in which the Committee has substantial input into the shape of the signal that’s in the statement.  The minutes actually say that the Committee agreed that the statement should say X.  It’s clear 217 of 261\f",
      "that the Committee is implicated in the statement.  The Chairman is obviously very deferential to the views of the Committee in shaping it, but we’re close to 80 percent of the way in having a formal endorsement by the Committee of the statement.  I don’t see any virtue in going the next 20 percent and a lot of virtue in preserving the possibility for the Chairman to say, “My sense is that we should do X,” (I know that’s not acceptable to all of you) and not have that come with something that forces a vote in that context.  I just don’t think the balance we have now is problematic, but I can envision a circumstance in which the state of the world, the state of the Committee, or a bunch of other things might make a formal vote unnecessary and tilt the balance in a way that may not make sense for the institutional structure we have.  You know, we have a group of nineteen, not of seven.  Fundamentally the Fed model institutionally is based on a strong Chairman, and I’d preserve that particular remaining piece of that model. \n",

      "MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, as best I can judge, recent readings on the economy are generally consistent with anticipation of moderate growth and some gradual diminution or at least no deterioration in inflation.  Second-quarter GDP readings, as far as I can tell, contain no big surprises.  In particular, the components of aggregate demand that were expected to bounce back after periods of sluggishness or, in some cases, correction—inventory accumulation, spending on equipment and software, and federal government outlays—all in fact did bounce back as anticipated.  The labor market report for July was positive, and anecdotes and indicators in our District are generally quite consistent with the tenor of that report.  The labor would say, is strong. Of course, all of that is by way of background because that information has been overshadowed in recent weeks by what I think are three or four developments of greater significance, one of which is the revision to the NIPA accounts.  The GDP and productivity data and, in particular, the downward revision to productivity may have significant implications for the longer-term performance of the economy.  I won’t dwell on that now.  Dave Wilcox covered some of that earlier.  There was also an upward revision to the personal saving rate, which possibly has implications for the outlook for consumer spending going forward, and I will come to that briefly in a moment.  Of course, the big headlines have been the turbulence in the financial markets and all the uncertainty associated with the duration of the repricing and the adjustments that are under way and their quantitative significance for the performance of the economy going forward.  This turbulence in the financial markets is likely the most significant development for the short-term performance of the economy and possibly for policy.  But at this point, it is very difficult, to put it mildly, to assess its effects for reasons I alluded to earlier—39 of 136\f",
      "namely, that we don’t know how long this will last and what will follow in its wake.  Even if we knew the duration, would we be—at least would I be—all that confident that we could go from that to the magnitude of the effects on the economy?  So all of that suggests to me that we should have a good deal of caution at the moment.  Since we don’t, it seems to me, know enough to act developments really have taken hold forcefully in the past several weeks.  The situation has not been so dramatic for any extended period of time. Returning to the saving rate for a moment, I am quite cautious about drawing implications for consumer spending on the basis of a judgment about whether the saving rate is likely to go up or down.  An argument has been popular in some circles that, with the negative saving rate as reported until recently in the data, the implications for consumer spending were likely that spending was going to be sluggish going forward because the negative saving rate couldn’t persist.  It seems to me that the argument now, at a minimum, has to be less compelling, and so, other things being equal, we might be tempted to become more optimistic about consumer spending.  That could be swamped, of course, by the negative wealth effects coming out of the adjustments in the financial markets and the tighter financial market conditions as well.  On net, I guess I come out where I usually do on this—that it is mostly a matter of employment and incomes—and so far so good on that score. Finally, and this is the fourth development that I will mention—although I don’t think it’s as important as the other three, but I did want to comment on it—it looks as though, as part of the revisions to the NIPA accounts, the increase in unit labor costs will be revised up for the previous three years—that is, for ’04, ’05, and ’06.  I think that’s right.  Now, this is a matter of correlation and not causation, but it does appear that there is a pretty high correlation in the short 40 of 136\f",

      "MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the beginning of the break, two of our leaders made a special point of indicating that I was first up after the break.  I guess that was an invitation to be fast and quick.  [Laughter]  I’ll try.   My overall impression from my business contacts is that things are more of the same rather than anything very much different.  I would note that the financial market upset is too recent to have affected the plans of companies operating in the real economy.  Obviously financial firms are scrambling.  There seems to be something of a disconnect between my trucking industry contacts and what I see in the industrial production numbers.  The industrial production numbers suggest that goods production is rising; I don’t know how they’re moving, but they don’t seem to be moving by truck.  One big over-the-road trucker says that loads are down 8 percent year over year.  The company has already cut trucking capacity 10 percent.  He expects another cut of 4 percent by the end of this year.  He’s trimming capital spending next year for trucks.  Obviously they see the business as being pretty slack.  Incidentally, nobody is talking about any particular labor market pressures.  Another big company probably best known for the color of its brown trucks [laughter] says that the industry overall is flat year over year.  It believes that the outlook is somewhat more optimistic than recent experience.  The international business is booming.  The Asia-Pacific region is shipping an awful lot of goods to both the United States and Europe.  My contact noted something that I thought was sort of interesting.  He said that there is some diversion from air freight to water transport—I guess because of the enormous cost difference, but it suggests that there may be a little easier inventory situation or something that is making that diversion make sense.  This company is very much in a cost-cutting mode because they have a big infrastructure, demand is relatively slack, and they have a lot of cost built in; and so the only thing they can do when they can’t build volume in the short run is to cut costs.  That company’s major competitor is 55 of 136\f",
      "much more optimistic and has capital spending plans for fiscal ’08, which ends in May of next year, up 20 percent from this year and sees a pretty strong business situation at least going forward. A contact in the restaurant industry says that restaurant prices are rising everywhere and volumes are falling, but overall business conditions are about the same.  The restaurant industry has been seeing that.  A contact with a major software firm is pretty optimistic.  PC sales are running at or above expectation.  My contact pointed out particularly that the quality of receivables has actually improved.  They’re not seeing any problem with collecting on the software that they sell, and 94 percent of the customers are current on making payments.  Even that is something of an underestimate because a lot of purchasers initiate the payment at the end of a thirty-day due period, and so the payment doesn’t come for another couple of days, despite our brilliant electronic clearing of payments. A comment about the housing industry:  Obviously the subprime issue is going to have a relatively permanent effect.  It is just changing the characteristic of this industry.  Underwriting was too lax, and that is changing.  I think it is somewhat surprising that the builders have not scaled back more quickly—that they continue to sit on such a large inventory.  Part of the reason is that, once a builder has started a development and has put all the infrastructure in place—the roads, the sewers, the water, and all of that—the only way to get anything out of that investment is to complete the subdivision.  In addition, a subdivision that stops is a bad signal for prospective buyers because they don’t want to move into something that is sitting there mostly idle.  So I think the builders have an intense interest in trying to complete these projects.  But what that means, of course, is that, as they complete those projects, they are not initiating a lot because they’re taking, as Richard pointed out, some pretty big price concessions in many cases, and so they are probably not going to be initiating as many projects in the future. 56 of 136\f",
      "My own bet is that the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally what’s going on in the real economy.  First of all, bank capital is not impaired.  So unlike in some past cases, when losses on real estate impaired bank capital and thus affected the lending in areas that had nothing to do with real estate, I don’t think that’s the case this time.  Second, the fact that some LBO deals fall through isn’t going to change what those companies are producing.  The fact that the ownership hasn’t changed doesn’t change the company’s profit-maximizing level of production in the short run.  Obviously, that could change, but it seems to me that the best information that we now have is that this financial market upset is going to settle out and not have major repercussions on the real economy, putting the housing part aside.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you for the useful discussion.  As usual, I am going to very briefly summarize what I heard.  I will be happy to take any comments on that.  Then I just want to make a few short points.  Again, most of the key points have been made. Most participants expect growth to remain moderate over the forecast period.  Despite lower household wealth resulting from weaker house and stock prices, consumption is likely to continue to grow as labor markets remain strong, real incomes increase, and gasoline prices moderate.  Business investment should also grow moderately, although lower productivity and higher volatility could be drags on investment.  Commercial real estate, in particular, may be slackening, but it retains good fundamentals.  The global economy is strong.  Industrial production is expanding at a reasonable pace.  However, downside risks to growth were noted and perhaps received somewhat greater emphasis than at past meetings.  Most notably, housing appears to have weakened further, with sales of new and existing homes declining and inventories of unsold homes remaining high.  Homebuilders are experiencing financial strains, and there is downward pressure on home prices.  Spillover on consumption spending is not yet evident but is a possible risk.  In this regard, developments in credit markets received considerable attention.  On the positive side, the repricing of risk and the reevaluation of underwriting standards seem appropriate.  Liquidity still exists, credit is still being extended, and markets may work out their problems on their own.  A lower dollar and lower long-term Treasury rates also tend to offset financial tightening.  However, higher risk premiums, tougher underwriting, and greater uncertainty may constrain housing and investment spending, leading to broader macroeconomic effects.  In more-pessimistic scenarios, dislocations in credit markets may last awhile and have a more substantial effect on credit availability and costs for businesses as well as for homebuyers.  82 of 136\f",
      "The possibility of contagion or severe financial instability also exists.  Many participants took note of the NIPA revisions and their implications for productivity growth, consumer saving, and unit labor costs.  Meeting participants tend to put potential growth at higher rates than the Greenbook. Views on inflation are similar to those in previous meetings.  Recent readings are viewed as reasonably favorable.  However, risks to inflation remain, including the possible reversal of transitory factors, tight labor markets, the high price of commodities, and higher unit labor costs resulting from lower productivity growth.  In all, the risks to inflation remain to the upside.  That is my summary of what I heard.  I’m sure a lot more could be said.  Any comments?   If not, let me just make a few additional comments.  There have been two very important developments since the last meeting.  The first was the downward revision to the NIPA growth numbers.  It’s not obvious yet, of course, how much of that reflects a permanent decline in productivity and how much is transitory.  But certainly the best guess is that some of it is more long term in nature.  I think the main point I’d like to make is that the implications of this downward revision for inflation and monetary policy, except perhaps in the very short run, are not obvious.  The question is, What is the effect of the lower productivity growth on aggregate demand?  We have examples of both types of phenomena.  In the late ’90s, the pickup in productivity growth stimulated a very strong boom working through the stock market, consumption, and investment, so it led to an overheating economy, whereas in the earlier part of this decade, productivity growth picked up again but with weak aggregate demand.  We had a jobless recovery associated with that.  So it remains to be seen exactly how aggregate demand will respond to these developments.  I do think that perhaps that in the very short run, given wage behavior and unit labor costs, if I had to choose, I would say that there is a slight bias 83 of 136\f",
      "toward higher inflation and tighter money.  In the longer run, you would expect to see lower long-term rates because of slower growth. The second issue that has been widely discussed around the table is the financial market.  It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth.  So it’s an interesting question about what is going on there.  I think there are three reasons that the financial markets have moved in the direction they have.  First, there has been a widespread repricing of risk.  That is, obviously, a healthy development, particularly if there is no overshoot, which is a possibility.  But all else being equal, it is restrictive in terms of aggregate demand, and it makes our policy tighter than it otherwise would be.  The second reason for the changes in quality, particularly in structured products.  There is an information fog, as I have heard it described.  This is very much associated with the loss of confidence in the credit-rating agencies.  I think one of the implications of this is that some of the innovations we have seen in financial distribute vehicles and put back onto portfolio balance sheets.  So the question is how much effect this adjustment process will have on the availability of credit.  The third reason that I think the markets have reacted as much as they have is concern about the macroeconomic implications of what is happening.  In particular, there is a fear that subprime losses, repricing, and the tightening of underwriting standards will have adverse effects on the housing market and will feed through to consumption, and we will get into a vicious cycle.  That certainly is reflected in the expectations of policy. 84 of 136\f",
      "I am not going to go through all the things that are going on now in the markets.  You have had very good reviews of that.  Obviously, the markets right now are not functioning normally.  Some conduits of credit are simply closed or frozen.  A number of companies are having difficulties with short-term finance, and so, per President Fisher’s comment, we are watching those things very carefully.  We are prepared to use the tools that we have to address a short-term financial crisis, should one occur.  In the longer term, of course, our policy should be directed not toward protecting financial investors but, rather, toward our macroeconomic objectives.  That is very important.  Then the question is what the long-run implications of the financial market adjustment will be for the economy.  I think the odds are that the market will stabilize.  Most credits are pretty strong except for parts of the mortgage market.  But even so there will be notably tighter credit, tighter standards, probably some loss of confidence in come in various magnitudes.  It could be moderate, or it could be more severe, and we are just going to have to monitor how it adjusts over time.  Again, there is a bit of a risk—and tail risk has been mentioned not only in a financial sense but also in the macro sense—that, if credit is severely restricted so that we get feedback from lower house prices, for example, into the financial markets, that situation would be difficult to deal with. Those are the two major issues that people have talked about.  Just very briefly on the overall assessment—on the output side, economic growth looks a little softer to me, mostly because of housing.  There are also some slightly worrying developments in terms of automobile demand, which suggest some weakening in consumer spending.  But there are some strong elements as well.  Also the labor market has marginally softened.  The unemployment rate is about 25 basis points above its recent low; so there has been some movement, and I still expect 85 of 136\f",
      "to see some reduction in construction employment.  So I think there is a bit more softness and there are a few more downside risks to output than at our last meeting.  Like others, I think the recent inflation data are moderately encouraging.  I continue to see risks.  If you’re not satiated with risks, I’ll add one more, which is that if the housing market really weakens and people go back to renting, we could get the same phenomenon that we saw last year, by which rents are driven up and we get an effect working through shelter costs.  So I agree with those who still view the risk to inflation as being tilted to the upside.  If there are no comments or questions, let me turn now to Brian to discuss the policy action.  \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  Well, Mr. Chairman, against this background of skittishness, my best advice would be to recognize, to an extent, in our statement what is going on in the marketplace, what ails the marketplace.  The best guidance would be that we must not ourselves become a tripwire.  I think we have to show a steady hand.  I rather liked the reference to the Hippocratic oath earlier, “Do no harm.”  I think we can best accomplish this by acknowledging market turbulence and yet not implying that we are given to a reaction that might create a moral hazard.  I’m particularly mindful of the discussion in the press and by security analysts of a so-called Bernanke put, and I want to make sure that we do not take any action or say anything that might give rise to an expectation that such is to occur.  Therefore, I would suggest that alternative B offers the best policy response.  That is, I am in favor of keeping the rate where it is.  The wording in the second paragraph acknowledges that there has been volatility in the markets.  I think it addresses the points Governor Kohn made about growth in employment, incomes, and a robust global economy.  I’ve waited a long time to see the word “global” in these statements.  [Laughter]  Whether it gets left in or not, it does reflect reality.  I’m mindful of President Geithner’s point of softening a little, and yet that is where I worry that we might become a bit of a tripwire.  I would under normal circumstances be somewhat inclined toward the last paragraph in alternative A, and yet I didn’t hear around the table, nor do I fully believe myself, that things are exactly roughly balanced.  I take the point that was made just now in the presentation that, by saying “downside risks to growth have increased somewhat,” we are opening the door. The only refinement that I might suggest is that we soften a little the word before “policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.”  By taking out the word “predominant,” I would leave that up for consideration.  I actually talked to somebody about this earlier; I want to acknowledge that.  But otherwise I would stick with alternative B, again, 89 of 136\f",
      "mindful that we are dealing with a skittish market situation and yet acknowledging the fact that a sense around this table is that there are risks to growth, that we are making progress on inflation, and yet there is no convincing evidence that we have completely turned the corner on the latter front.

      "MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the inflation news has continued to be encouraging, but the risks remain on the upside.  With respect to growth, the prospects have worsened, and I think there is greater downside risk for the reasons that we have discussed.  I think the market response to these events is not inappropriate.  They perceive a greater likelihood that we will need to cut the fed funds rate sooner and more deeply than seemed likely only a few weeks ago, and I think we should essentially try to leave those expectations in place today to indicate that we intend not to respond to asset prices or to the problems of particular dealers or financial institutions directly but to assess the economic consequences of the turmoil. So the question is, What is the right language to do that?  The alternative B language that is proposed is trying to achieve exactly what I think is appropriate.  So I agree with the goal of alternative B.  I’m simply concerned about some of the actual language that is proposed.  Particularly I worry about the language in paragraph 4.  When you say “although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate,” that’s like saying—perhaps because I respond so strongly to the word “predominant”—that, yes, we see greater downside risk, but we don’t care; we remain totally focused on inflation.  [Laughter]  That bothers me.  That’s how it comes across to me.  I don’t think the intention is to make it that way.   So I would make two proposals to soften it.  I think what we need to do is dial it down, but I do think that inflation risk remains to the upside.  I would second two suggestions that have already been made.  I would second President Fisher’s suggestion that we remove the word “predominant” from paragraph 4.  We might say, “The Committee remains concerned about the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.”  Now, I do think the downside risk has increased on the growth side.  I’m not sure it is actually necessary to say so explicitly, and I think 95 of 136\f",
      "dialing down paragraph 4 by simply removing “predominant,” along with the additional language that is proposed in line 2, might be sufficient.  But I think that we actually do agree that downside risks have increased.  If we want to express that, I would endorse President Poole’s suggestion that we move the language about downside risks to paragraph 2, saying something after “for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.”  We could then say, “Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, nevertheless the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace.”  So we would get it in there.  Basically we would say that we see it, but nevertheless we think most likely the economy will grow at a moderate pace.  If financial turbulence diminishes and markets stabilize, not having downside risks to growth in paragraph 4 and continuing to express some asymmetric bias, some worry about inflation, we’ll be comfortable living with that going forward, and it is a good summary of where we are.  So those are my suggestions. \n",

      "MR. DUDLEY.  Well, it’s difficult to sort out exactly how much of that term premium that we see in the term funding markets represents counterparty risk versus balance sheet constraints.  I think in the United States that it is probably more of a balance sheet issue.  In Europe it’s probably more counterparty risk.  The general sense is that the U.S. banks are very healthy and, as you note, well capitalized.  However, the fact that you still have quite a bit of room before you hit that boundary of “well capitalized” doesn’t mean that the banks aren’t concerned about potential balance sheet pressures.  The problem they have right now is that they can’t really size with any accuracy how much will be coming onto their balance sheets over the next few months through asset-backed commercial paper, through bank conduits, and through other things for which they may be on the hook that they didn’t expect to be on the hook for.  So I wouldn’t take the boundary line of “well capitalized” versus “not well capitalized” as the constraint.  I think the constraint actually starts to bind quite a bit before you get to that point. \n",

It was a little bloody, but I want to commend you in that I think it was a fairly balanced way of looking at what the risks are in various places.  But I want to come back to my interpretation of what you just said.  Your answer to President Evans sounded to me as though a significant part of your downward revision, particularly to consumption, was the factor of consumer sentiment, which is looming rather large in this forecast.  While you’ve revised down some other things, it sounded as though you were saying that consumer sentiment is a particularly sensitive and difficult thing to forecast.  We know it is very volatile; it can change rapidly.  But I heard you say that in the forecast you have implicitly reduced consumer spending and held it low for a period of time into the forecast.

      "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given my outlook for growth and inflation and my assessment of the neutral federal funds rate, I can readily agree to 50 basis points in cuts on a cumulative basis.  I came into this meeting having a slight preference for alternative C and doing 25 basis points today with an expectation of 25 at the next meeting.  I thought that that would take us to a point at which more data would come out and it would be more likely that we could perhaps stop at a 4¾ percent fed funds rate.  Obviously, if we cut 50 basis points today, and I have no disagreement with that, I think it is then a little more difficult to stop there.  I agree with some of the previous comments that any action beyond that should be based on incoming data that we don’t expect.  That is kind of difficult from a communication standpoint.  But I’m fine with alternative B.  In fact, the language is fine. I’d just like to take a minute to talk about risk management.  We talked a lot about that in terms of tail risk and nonlinearities and insurance, and I think this is quite appropriate in the current environment.  But we have to continue to ask, What happens in the more likely event that things turn out better than these tail events?  That’s why they’re called tail events.  So I agree with Governor Mishkin that we have to be very careful to think about taking them back.  If we respond aggressively to address financial conditions beyond our dual mandate goals, we should be prepared to retrace that pattern of federal funds rate cuts if conditions calm.  With respect to the comments that Governor Kroszner made about inflation, I think you have to be a little careful.  My memory of ’98 was that we actually had a tightening bias when the Russian default–LTCM came in.  We cut 75 basis points.  Things got better.  By the spring, we were debating whether or not we should tighten.  By the June meeting, we did begin to tighten, and we went up to 6½ percent.  My memory of core CPI in 2000 is that it increased about ¾ percentage point.  I think there was some divergence 109 of 188\f",

If you have to submit your bid on Monday to get awarded on Thursday, this is not the action of a bank that’s desperate for funding.  I think the stigma comes because, at the discount window, apart from bidding strongly at the end of the day and then ending up paying this penalty rate, you don’t have anywhere else to go.  So it seems to me this auction facility looks much more like a liability-management facility than it does a facility for banks that absolutely have to get funds, given that there’s a three-day or four-day wait until you get them. \n",

There is certainly a risk that this facility will not be—well, maybe this would not be a wrong judgment—available to small banks, and the large banks would be getting access to discount window funds at a rate potentially well below that available to small banks.  If this were to become a political controversy with some of those who are less friendly to us in the Congress than others, it would complicate the value of this.  I would hate to see us get embroiled in a political controversy over this because we were discriminating against 98 percent of the banks in the Eighth Federal Reserve District as well as some of the other Federal Reserve Districts. If we were to launch this, if we were voting today, this would create a big issue in terms of our directors because we would be announcing to the directors what discount rate they would have to set under the Federal Reserve Act.  So if we are preparing to do this in the future, I think it is very important that we have material prepared and that we take it up with our directors in advance so that they will know what we will be asking of them because this could be a very big problem.  We need to make sure that we have the directors on our side and that we have prepared them so that, if we have to do it, they will know what the reasoning is. Finally, once the dust settles, assuming that we don’t need to do this before the markets return to a reasonable normality, I don’t see any reason that we couldn’t have this well planned and actually run a trial or maybe even have a trial once a year or something like that so that the banks and the markets understand how this works.

      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, a lot of what I have thought about this since I realized we weren’t going to do this immediately has been addressed by the previous individuals who have spoken.  I’d just like to touch on a few points.  First, like everyone else, I want to congratulate the staff for excellent work.  It is creative.  It’s also very well balanced in the way that the pros and the cons are argued.  Bagehot and the Lombard facility not withstanding, it seems to me that, if we proceed down this path, we have to position it so that it’s a refinement of what we did in August rather than a confession of failure or insufficiency.  That would be point number 1.   Still, President Lacker made some very good points, and part of this gets to what President Poole just mentioned, and that is that some political risk, in addition to the risk of failure, is there and we have to acknowledge that it may not work.  I have some concerns about the value of collateral and the automaticity, as it were, in this kind of new facility and our ability to value complicated collateral.   My biggest concerns are the ideas, as President Lacker put it, that we’re subsidizing foreign banks without really doing anything to mitigate hazard.  I think that roughly translates what he said, which gets me to the point of President Poole’s comment.  We have to be mindful of the risk of being perceived as (1) helping a limited number of very large money center banks and (2) bailing out the Europeans.  Now, we understand that.  I don’t think the public understands that.  If you look at my discount window, there are five banks that could meet these collateral requirements, the $63 million minimum.  Some Districts have less; some Districts have more.  Our backbone at the Federal Reserve in terms of our political support is the community banking system.  To be sure, we all understand that we have systemic responsibilities, but the idea that we might be facilitating these huge institutions or “bailing out” the Europeans is just a risk I think we need to be aware of, and if we proceed, we’re going to have to figure out how to manage that. 154 of 188\f",
      "I’m not against a swap line, another point that President Lacker made.  Usually I would expect President Lacker to be against a swap line, but he’s not against the swap line.  I’m not against the swap line.  It does beg the question of whether we couldn’t do a swap line and work with the existing facility but for the fact that we think that the existing facility is insufficient.  Again, I would present this, if we proceed, as a refinement. Mr. Chairman, I would like more time to think about this.  I’m grateful that you’re giving us more time to think about it, and I, again, would like to consider the governance aspects of it.  But those are the questions that I have at this juncture.

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think this is aimed at addressing a serious problem that I’m afraid we’re losing sight of a bit.  The piling-up of financing in very short term vehicles is an issue for financial stability.  Partly this is, yes, the term rates are elevated, and if this were just a risk premium on certain counterparties, I don’t think that would be a big deal.  But I do feel that there has been a malfunctioning in the markets:  As is typical in a financial crisis or panic, people have fled toward liquidity and safety in Treasury bills and overnight lending, and the normal arbitrage that happens across markets just isn’t happening.  It’s great that the markets seem to be getting better, but if they continue to malfunction or if it gets worse again, I think there’s a serious problem.  The problem is that all these banks are being financed in the one-day to four-day area, and it leaves them open to huge rollover risk and huge liquidity risk.  In turn, because they have this risk, they’re more reluctant to lend.  They’re more reluctant to use all that capital that you saw in the chart the other day.  So it is having a potential macroeconomic effect, and I completely agree with President Stern.  We would do it because there’s a macroeconomic effect and because there is a financial stability effect.  But I think there is an issue here that we can’t shrug off.  I agree that the facility would attract those banks that need it most.  That’s what auctions do, right?  That’s why they’re designed that way, and I think that’s fine.  For the most part, with one exception, that’s the way it would have the maximum effect of relieving some of these issues.  You bring in the folks who need it the most, and it relieves some of their problems.  That is a problem regarding the borderline institutions that people have been talking about, and if an institution is in transition from being sound to being not sound, this is an issue.  It’s an issue for two reasons.  One is that it could facilitate the runoff of uninsured liability holders, and the Congress has told us not to do that, and we shouldn’t do it.  That’s a moral hazard problem.  The second is that it might allow the banks that aren’t being run well to make that last bet—to do some other things that would put 160 of 188\f",
      "them at greater risk.  But I think those would be very, very rare institutions that are in that kind of spot where they’re just placing the final bet before going out of business.  So the borderline institution is a bit of a problem, but I’m not sure it’s as big a problem as others have said. I think this would have a chance of success.  There are no guarantees.  I absolute agree.  When arbitrage isn’t working, you have very strong preferred habitats.  People want to lend short, and other people want to borrow long, and the Fed would be stepping into that breach in some sense where the markets aren’t working.  We would be supplying Treasury bills and, to a certain extent, doing matched sale-purchases or reverse RPs or whatever they call them these days, borrowing from the public at the very short term, and we would be extending the term credit.  In a sense, we would be stepping in for the arbitrage that’s not happening, and that would relieve pressures on these markets at least a little.  It has a chance of having some second-round effects of helping those banks that want to use their capital do so more than they are already.  So no guarantees.  I don’t know that it would remove the stigma.  As I said, I think the auction process, making it a totally very, very different from a discount rate loan. On the moral hazard issue, of course, this isn’t doing anything really to relieve people who made subprime loans.  It’s not going to change the price of those assets, so it’s not really affecting that in any moral hazard way.  It’s not aimed at individual institutions.  It’s more like open market operations than it is like the old form of discount window lending.  Even when normal functioning is restored to markets, banks will be paying for the liquidity insurance that they wrote.  There’s no relief on the credit side.  They’ll still have to tie up capital, making good on the liquidity insurance, forgoing more-profitable opportunities.  It would reduce, perhaps at least a little around the edges, the extra cost of financing this liquidity insurance that they sold that comes from the disruption of 161 of 188\f",
      "the markets, from the fire sale aspect.  I think that, if we thought that the markets weren’t improving and it would have a feedback effect on financial stability, stepping in would be worthwhile.  That’s the classic central bank thing to do—to step in and relieve some of the extra panicky pressures on the markets to get them functioning again.  So I guess I don’t see an important moral hazard issue or, to the extent that there is a moral hazard issue, I think it would be more than offset by the benefits to the macroeconomy of the functioning of financial markets, should we decide that this were needed if those markets weren’t working.

      "MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many others around the table, my report to this Committee in September indicated a sharp deterioration in business confidence.  My business contacts were concerned about what may happen.  During the intermeeting period I heard less about what may happen and more about what is actually happening.  My contacts who are linked to residential real estate have seen a further and, in some cases, sharp drop-off in business activity.  My banking supervision and regulation staff told me just a few days ago that they’re now seeing a sudden and sizable percentage increase in nonperforming loans at a number of large banking companies in my District.  To be sure, nonperforming loans had been at extremely low levels, and most of the sharp rise can be traced to mortgage and construction development lending.  But I’m now beginning to hear reports that bankers are experiencing some loan performance problems outside their real estate portfolio.  The CEO of a large, major bank in my District has also reported difficulty in securitizing the student loans that they’re making, forcing them to keep those loans on their books and to make adjustments elsewhere in their balance sheets.  To what extent these banking conditions are affecting overall bank lending is not obvious, but clearly there has been some disruption to the channels of intermediation, and I am now beginning to hear reports of some spillover to other sectors of the economy.  A growing number of retailers tell me that they have seen a noticeable decline in spending since mid-September in items ranging from autos to apparel. While my reports from the business community reflect a falloff in business conditions from what we submitted to the Beige Book just a few weeks ago, they don’t necessarily indicate a significant deviation from the slowdown that was already built into the economic projections that I submitted in September.  In preparing for this meeting, I found it difficult to judge whether the reports of weakness that I am hearing represent an unfolding of the September projection or additional deterioration in the outlook.  In the end, I have only minor differences with the 41 of 162\f",
      "Greenbook projection in the near term and, like the Greenbook, made only minor revisions to my forecast.  I see economic activity a bit softer than the Greenbook for the remainder of 2007, but I project slightly better growth in 2008.  Like the Greenbook, I have assumed an unchanged path for the fed funds rate over the forecast period.  The recent rise in oil prices has caused me to push up my near-term PCE projection, but inflation expectation projections remain anchored around 2 percent.  I see a small upside risk to the near-term inflation projection as a result of the continuing dollar depreciation; but on the whole, I continue to judge our inflation risks as reasonably balanced. I would like to conclude by echoing the sentiments of others around the table.  Considerable strains in the financial sector remain, and further turmoil in markets is a distinct possibility.  I think that, in this environment, households and businesses can easily be spooked—excuse the Halloween pun—and I don’t think it would take much additional tightness in credit markets to push my fragile near-term growth outlook even lower.  So this concern continues to be the predominant risk to my outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

So I don’t really know what is happening there in terms of this particular figure.  In terms of durable goods, given what we’ve seen, I think that it would still be early at this point for any credit restriction to have left much of an imprint on capital spending or durable goods orders.  We are looking for that.  We have been a little surprised at the strength there, so I think that would be part of a question mark in our own minds as to whether we have overestimated the restraint.  But as I said yesterday, given the data that we currently have in hand, I think it is probably too early to see a significant mark yet from the credit restraint.  If we don’t over the next three or four months, that will more seriously call into question our forecast.  Now, we have not built in a very large capital spending effect from the financial turmoil because we basically think corporate finance is still looking pretty good.

      "MR. MADIGAN.4  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”  That package includes two versions of table 1:  The first is the version that was discussed in the Bluebook, and the second is a revised version dated October 31.  The revised table presents basically the same policy alternatives as the Bluebook version but with some changes in the rationale and risk assessment sections.  To review, alternatives B and C contemplate leaving the stance of policy unchanged today, but they differ importantly in their assessments of risk:  Alternative C characterizes the downside risks to growth as roughly offsetting the upside risks to inflation, whereas alternative B indicates that the downside risks to growth are the Committee’s greater policy concern.  Alternative A, in contrast, eases the stance of monetary policy 25 basis points and indicates that the Committee assesses the risks to growth and inflation as roughly in balance.  In discussing these alternatives, I will basically be working from right to left across the two versions of the table.    As Dave Stockton discussed yesterday in response to a question from Vice Chairman Geithner, the Greenbook projection is a modal forecast.  Without consideration of risks, the Greenbook analysis would seem to support the Committee’s selection of alternative C.  In that forecast, which is conditioned on the federal funds rate remaining at 4¾ percent, economic growth slows in the near term, and below-trend growth over the next few quarters closes the small positive output gap that the staff sees as currently prevailing.  Maintaining the present stance of monetary policy leads to a gradual strengthening of the expansion over 2008 and 2009 and by enough to leave the economy producing at its capacity.  Core inflation stays under 2 percent, while total inflation runs a bit lower, reflecting declining energy prices.  Judging by your projections, most of you would find such a trajectory for inflation satisfactory, at least for the next couple of years if not over the longer term.  Your projection submissions, however, as well as your comments yesterday, suggest that many of you see less vigor in aggregate demand than the Greenbook does as well as appreciable downside risks—an outlook that might argue against alternative C.  The Greenbook provided several alternative simulations involving greater weakness in housing and larger fallout from financial stress that illustrate some prominent risks to spending; they suggested that the path of the federal funds rate might need to run ¾ percentage point or more below baseline should such weakness in aggregate demand eventuate.      The choice of alternative B could be consistent with a modal expectation along the lines of the Greenbook coupled with appreciable concerns about downside risks and a judgment that you need to await additional information before deciding whether to ease policy further.  As noted in alternative B, section 2, of either version, the statement would in effect explain the decision to stand pat, first, by recognizing that economic growth last quarter was solid and perhaps conveying the implicit suggestion that the economy was likely to continue to expand at an acceptable pace, even if growth were to slow temporarily; second, by noting that strains in financial                                                  4 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). 82 of 162\f",
      "economy apart from housing has proven resilient and that the global economy remains strong.  At the same time, the statement would indicate that the Committee is concerned about downside risks to growth, explicitly citing the potential effect of tightening credit conditions.  Regarding inflation, the language would be identical to that used in September.  The statement would conclude by indicating that, on balance, the Committee saw the downside risks to growth as the greater policy concern.      As Bill Dudley noted, the market was all but certain as of yesterday that you will ease policy today 25 basis points.  Today, in response to the economic data released earlier, intermediate and longer-term interest rates have risen somewhat; however, futures quotes still suggest that investors now see high odds that you will ease policy today.  Thus, the announcement of an unchanged stance of policy would come as a considerable surprise to markets.  To be sure, the assessment under alternative B that the downside risks are the greater policy concern and its implication that further easing might well be forthcoming before long would soften the blow.  But a selloff in bond and equity markets would no doubt ensue.  Moreover, financial asset prices could remain volatile for a time, as investors attempted to recalibrate their expectations of the probable path of monetary policy going forward.    Concern about such market reactions clearly would not persuade you to ease policy at this meeting if you judged that an unchanged stance of policy would likely be more consistent with maximum employment and stable prices, and hitching monetary policy to market expectations would make for extremely poor economic outcomes.  But especially in circumstances of persisting financial strains, concern about unnecessarily adding to those strains might incline you a bit more toward easing, as in alternative A, if you were already strongly leaning that way today based on your view of economic and financial fundamentals.  As I noted yesterday, your economic projections suggest that most of you believe that the stance of policy should be eased within the next six to twelve months, and many of you indicated that some easing was appropriate imminently.  You may see several reasons for preferring to move earlier rather than later.  In particular, you may think that a timely reduction in interest rates could be valuable now in buoying household, business, and investor confidence.  Yesterday the Chairman noted the possibility of a vicious cycle involving a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and tightening credit conditions.  By bolstering confidence in the outlook, easing policy as expected could help reduce concerns about deteriorating economic fundamentals and declining asset values.  Beyond reducing the risks of nonlinear responses, easing policy as expected by usual channels.     Of course, you may also be worried about a possible increase in inflation.  Such concerns may reflect a variety of factors—the further sharp increase in oil prices of recent weeks, the depreciation of the dollar, accelerating unit labor costs, and perhaps the relatively high level of resource utilization.  But given the recent good inflation performance, you may feel that downside risks to growth are the more immediate danger and believe that further easing today to address those risks is warranted.

      "may also believe that, should the easing eventually appear to have been unnecessary, you could act as quickly to remove stimulus as you did to put it in place.  If you were inclined toward easing policy another 25 basis points at this meeting, you would need to confront the question of the appropriate statement language.  In both versions of alternative A, the first two sentences of section 2 are similar to those proposed for alternative B.  But rather than emphasizing remaining downside risks, the statement would then repeat most of the “help forestall” language used in September.  The language proposed for the inflation paragraph in both versions is identical to the corresponding paragraph suggested for alternative B; again, the language shown in the October 31 version suggests a bit more concern about inflation risks than the upside risks to inflation as roughly balancing the downside risks to growth.  This indication might well lead market participants to reduce the nearly two-thirds odds that they currently place on another quarter-point easing in December and might trim the extent of the overall easing of policy anticipated over the next year or so.  Thus, implementation of alternative A also could prompt some further backup in market interest rates.  In closing, let me remind the Committee that the September trial run highlighted the potential for inconsistencies between the results of the projections survey and the Committee’s statement.  Your latest forecast submissions indicated that, while a minority of you sees the risks to inflation as skewed to the upside, a slight majority perceives the risks to total inflation as broadly balanced, and a more-sizable majority judges that the risks to core inflation are in balance.  These results could be seen as incongruent with the draft statements for some of the alternatives.  For example, alternative A references upside risks to inflation.  Several considerations might explain this apparent inconsistency.  For example, your responses on skews in the projections survey may capture only the subjective probabilities that you attach to various outcomes, while you may see the statement language as capturing not only the odds but also the economic costs associated with those outcomes.  Or perhaps the upside risks to inflation referenced in the statement should be interpreted as reflecting the views of all members not just of the majority who saw inflation risks as balanced, thus encompassing the views of those in the minority who see upside inflation risks.  Finally, I am worried about the possibility that some of you may have provided your numerical projections under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy but may not have applied that assumption as well to your individual risk assessments.  In your upcoming remarks, you may wish to address whether there is any tension between your own views of the distribution of risks and the risk assessments in the draft statements.  Thank you.   \n",

So the only changes from the Bluebook in A-3 and C-3 are that there’s a more expansive description of the inflation risks, and in A-4 there is simply the phrase “after this action.”  Those are the only changes from the Bluebook.

      "MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I take the view that a cut today is justified on the basis that keeping rates where they currently are leaves us with a lot of downside risk.  That’s exactly what I’ve been hearing from other people.  If there is, in fact, downside risk, why not move today?  I would be very troubled by not changing and still using the language in alternative B because it says there’s a lot of downside risk.  Then there is the problem of why we are sitting there and not doing anything.  On just the straight economic issues, I think that a cut could be justified.  In particular, I was one of the people who advocated a cut at this meeting.  In fact, I was being a bit—I don’t know what the right word is—flamboyant when I suggested a cut of 50 basis points and then that we might move back up 25 basis points.  I was trying to make the point that I was very concerned about the macroeconomic risk, the potential for a downward spiral of financial disruption leading to problems in the real sector and then feeding back on the financial markets, and really felt that we needed to keep ahead of the curve. What is key is that the response to our actions on September 18 was almost textbook perfect in the sense that the markets really got the message that we were not going to be asleep at the wheel.  As a result, the macro risk was taken out of these markets, and we achieved exactly the kind of signaling that we intended.  So clearly I do not feel that we need to get ahead of the curve in that sense, the way I did last time.  Also very important in my thinking about the macro issues is that I think inflation expectations are contained.  We have been able to achieve that.  In particular, there is a bit of concern about inflation compensation having gone up in terms of the spread between nominal rates and TIPS.  But the analysis that I’ve heard from people who are much more knowledgeable about the way yield curves operate is that the way to interpret this is that there’s an increase in uncertainty about what inflation would be.  I hope that our communications strategy will help in that regard.  In fact, that provision of information will actually help the markets in the 110 of 162\f",
      "current environment.  Furthermore, the Michigan survey has, if anything, gotten better in terms of inflation expectations.  I always get a little nervous about asking regular people what they think because if you ask them what they’re watching on TV, they’re never going to tell you that they’re watching Vanna White.  They’ll tell you that they’re watching ballet or the History Channel.  [Laughter]  But I don’t see a problem there, and that the ECI numbers came in the way they did also gives me some confidence on the inflation front. I am very concerned about Charlie’s issue—I always call President Plosser “Charlie” because we have known each other such a long time—about being led by the markets.  It is very important that we not get into that box.  I worry about that, but I am a bit less worried about it in this context in that we affirmed last meeting that we were not being led by the markets because we sure as heck surprised them.  So the fact that we don’t surprise them this time to me does not create a pattern that we’re just doing whatever the market tells us. I also want to raise a consideration that I think deserves some emphasis, which is thinking about scenarios of what may happen.  This relates to what Bill talked about, but I want to be a little more explicit.  I want to ask myself what might happen as a result of our policy actions today and what the implications might be for the economy.  In particular, let’s think about the case of our doing alternative B.  In that case, I think there is a significant probability that the markets would react quite negatively and that the macro risk that we took out by our action on September 18 might creep back into the credit markets.  I’m actually very worried about the skittishness of the credit I would have no disagreement at all with Charlie on the issue that, if you are in a normal situation, then you definitely do not want to be led by the markets at all.  But I think that we do have to worry about market considerations a bit more in the current situation, when we could have a negative 111 of 162\f",
      "reaction to what we do.  That creates problems in the credit markets, and then that weakens the outlook for the economy and there is an issue about what do we do then.  If we then cut in south, that could be very, very problematic. But I do not think that cutting today will have very negative effects on inflation expectations.  However, I do think that the issue of going forward is very important, and this relates to the statement.  I strongly agree that we need a much stronger balance and an indication that our action today—if we do what I suggest, which is to cut 25 basis points—does not mean that we expect to cut at the next meeting or further out.  We really need to make that very clear.  The statement will be one part of it, although I worry very much about the issue that we always put much too much weight on the statement and that we don’t have other means of communicating.  I’m not sure what to do about this; I’ve been thinking about it and haven’t come up with any good answers.  But there are issues in terms of how other central banks communicate things beyond the statement that are hard to communicate with fifteen words rather than something more extensive. So my view—and it is reflected in my projections—is that, if we cut 25 basis points, it’s not clear to me that the balance of risks is so much to the downside.  I think the risks to the downside have been very substantially eliminated—not that they aren’t still there to some extent.  I think they are but not really as much, and I think that is true of the actions on September 18 and today.  Because I’m never very precise in my language—as you know, I tend to say pitiful things—somebody will craft this much better than I do.  But I’m wondering about the assessment of risk.  Let me make a suggestion, although I’m not sure this is the best way to do it.  We need to emphasize that it’s not just the upside risks to inflation but also the downside risks to the economy that have lessened.  It is also important when we have a 25 basis point cut not to say to the markets 112 of 162\f",
      "that we’re so worried about the economy.  One possibility might be, for example, to say that “the Committee judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the somewhat reduced downside risks to growth.”  So we would not be saying that there isn’t some downside risk but that it’s not really as strong as we thought.  It’s certainly not as strong as we thought on you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

I think the balance of risk statement in the announcement has had the utility weight on it; there have been times when the Committee was more concerned about falling to one side or another.

I was wondering whether, if you changed the scale—[laughter].  This is a concern with no real suggested solution—I apologize.  My second point is more significant.  Bill, I think you asked a good question.

Although it is true that spreads remain wide, the absolute level of the high-quality rates in general has come down, I believe.  Prime mortgage rates are down, and it seems to me that if we look only at spreads then, of course, our actions to reduce the federal funds rate target may not show up for quite some time.  In fact, I think most people have the sense that spreads had gotten too narrow and they may end up being elevated for a long time even as a “permanent” matter.  So I think it is very important to look at the level of rates as well as the spreads, and I insert the comment—and I notice you’re nodding your head “yes”—that the rates on high-quality paper have in general come down.  The rates on riskier paper are perhaps higher than they were, let’s say, in July. \n",

That said, we see the contribution from net exports falling off from a substantial 1.4 percentage points in Q3 to just a touch above 0.1 in Q4, and that’s driven by a moderation in export growth and continued 4 percent import growth.

      "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to be generally sound but with some notable areas of weakness.  Our survey readings on the services firms indicate continued moderate growth in November, and our index of manufacturing activity gained a few points following a sharp decline in October, though it remains in neutral territory.  A number of our contacts reported that the weaker dollar is providing a boost to manufacturing exports, and I have noticed a definite increase in the number of coal trains rumbling by my office on their way from West Virginia to port.  On the other hand, our merchant contacts were much less optimistic about their sales prospects going into the holiday season.  Our retail sales survey indicator slid another 8 points, pulled down by significant declines in big ticket sales and shopper traffic components.  District housing markets continue to weaken overall, with distinctly more-pessimistic tones in some markets, particularly around the D.C. area, although there are a couple of areas that are still reporting decent activity to the south. In commercial real estate, reports from the retail and industrial markets are generally upbeat.  One former director, whose firm owns a sizable portfolio of retail properties throughout the East Coast, described the sector as in the best shape he has seen in his lifetime, and he is by no means a young man.  Industrial leasing appears to be in good shape, even tight in some office leasing activity in October and early November. The community bankers I have talked with say that portfolios are still quite clean but that they are scrutinizing deals much more carefully in the current environment.  They also complain that large banks are raising deposit rates and competing more intensely for deposits.  At large banks, the cost of capital has increased, and they are responding accordingly by reevaluating the 40 of 138\f",
      "profitability of various lines of business.  This does not appear to have resulted in any wholesale cutback in lending but more in a tightening of terms in selected market segments. I view the information from our District as fairly consistent with my economic outlook at the national level.  Housing investment continues to contract, and the overhang of unsold homes and general tightening of credit terms suggest a quite prolonged period of relatively depressed activity.  Consumer spending clearly has slowed.  For the months of September and October, real consumption showed almost no growth.  While early reports on the holiday shopping season are notoriously slippery, it seems clear that shoppers are far from ebullient, perhaps with the exception of these GPS toys.  This seems consistent with the virtual absence of growth in real disposable income over the past two months and the flattening-out of household net worth in the third quarter.  Job growth has shifted down to a more modest pace over this year, and revisions to the payroll series, when we finally get them, seem likely to make the slowdown look bigger.  So it wouldn’t surprise me if consumer spending came in fairly tame next year.  I am expecting a slowdown in consumer spending growth, however, not a sharp pullback.  Labor markets are still fairly tight.  Household net worth is still at fairly elevated levels.  So while the increase in the saving rate projected by the Greenbook for next year is plausible, I think consumer spending could come out on the high side of that forecast. A key factor in the outlook and a key source of uncertainty is the continuing drama in credit markets.  Large banks are bringing impaired assets onto their balance sheets and are facing a higher cost of capital and increased funding costs.  It would seem reasonable to expect them to respond by tightening terms of credit for households and business borrowers, implying a further drag on spending.  The magnitude of this sort of fallout is still quite uncertain.  Reduced credit flows appear so far to be less a reduction in credit supply than in demand.  That is, they appear to 41 of 138\f",
      "reflect a genuine deterioration in borrower creditworthiness in some segments.  Residential real estate fits this description as does some, though not all, commercial real estate.  Beyond these sectors, we have seen some evidence of yield spreads widening, but the cost of credit to investment-grade nonfinancial firms is low and has been falling along with the risk-free rate, at least until very recently.  The flow of credit to such firms seems to have been holding up well, as has the nonmortgage consumer credit flow.  So at this point, it does not look as though an indiscriminate, across-the-board credit crunch is taking place, although marginally higher credit costs may exert some additional drag on spending growth.  Overall, then, I do see a weaker outlook for growth in the near term, and the timing of the return to trend is going to depend somewhat on the bottoming-out of the housing cycle, which unfortunately appears to be getting even more remote each time we meet. If we have a more protracted slowdown ahead of us, as seems likely now, we need to be careful not to lose sight of inflation.  Core PCE inflation has edged up over the past two months, and it now appears likely to move above 2 percent for a time.  Overall inflation, of course, has been higher on average over the last year, and we have seen a slight upward trend in five-year-forward inflation compensation since earlier in the year.  In fact, the behavior of energy and food prices over the past several years calls into question the standard presumption we make that overall inflation is going to return to the core inflation trend in a reasonable period of time.  That points to the possibility that inflation may give us more trouble ahead. \n",

While I think it is a close call, I guess I would come out with doing a quarter at this meeting.  Basically, I get there by just trying to weigh the risks.  I think the principal risk is the dysfunction in financial markets and what that could imply prospectively for the performance of the economy.  I think that is the basic case for taking action now.  I think the risks are asymmetric.  I don’t see the same risk to the near or intermediate term in terms of inflation outlook.  Yes, we may get some high headline numbers, but we hope at least that those will dissipate rather quickly.  So that is where I come out.   I would support the language under alternative B.  Just to add one thought on that:  You know, last time we tried to characterize the balance of risk, and I don’t think it turned out to be persuasive.  We would do well to be very, very cautious at this point.  Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty out there, and at this point, discretion is the better part of valor. \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I don’t think I could have said it better than Governor Kohn said it.  I am on his wavelength.  I would just add a couple of things that I would suggest we consider.  First of all, with regard to the financial situation, which is obviously driving this conversation, I appreciate the medical pathology that the Vice Chairman suggested.  We have gone now from cardiology, which is my thing, to this fever and the fever breaking, and so on.  I combine it with a bit of the strawman that Governor Warsh raised.  No one has suggested a panacea.  No one has suggested that the existing pool of ersatz money, outside money, or shadow money is fully sufficient to relieve the stress the system is under.  What has changed, however, since the August crisis is the process of price discovery.  We are beginning to actually get realistic pricing.  I spent twenty-one years buying distressed assets on Wall Street.  I think I understand the process.  It is a patient process, and it takes time.  But I think that is the only difference.  We have begun the process; it has a long way to go.  We have enormous risks, and I fully agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that there is significant risk that might stem from this.  But let’s not also understate the fact that some adjustment has begun and that is good news. I would suggest 25 basis points, Mr. Chairman, because I think we have to be very wary of shooting an entire bolt here.  If we do 50 basis points plus the TAF plus the swap lines—this is all very subjective—my opinion is that we would scare the hell out of the markets.  There is a significant risk if we send a signal, as was previously said—I think Brian may have said this—that we have information that other people do not have.  President Lockhart referred to delicate psychology.  From a risk-management standpoint, I think the psychology is the opposite of what he stated, which is that we are at risk of interfering with the beginning of the adjustment process that I just described.  If people feel that we know more than they do, that we have greater fear of the downside, you are going to see a delay in that adjustment.  They are wanting to step up and 109 of 138\f",
      "cherry-pick a little before you start going through the whole orchard.  So those would be the two factors that I would suggest.  I want to come back to the last point.  Our job is to keep inflation at bay.  The nominal anchor you mentioned is critical.  I heard more people speak around this table about being worried about inflation than did not so speak.   And a second-to-the-last point.  I agree with President Poole and the suggestion of, I think, Charlie Plosser.  I would like to be like the Reserve Bank of Australia and raise the rates despite the political election, if we had to.  But I think the scrutiny of this institution will be intense, and my preferred mode is just to stay out of the way.  I think it is politically very brave and possibly foolish to say that, well, if we do too much here, we can always pull it back.  There will be a lot different circumstances next year, and I worry that we may do too much.  I would be against 50 basis points.  I would be in favor of 25 basis points, and I would be in favor of alternative B as stated, if I had a vote.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  \n",

The best way to look at it is just to look at the New York District, which is taking an overwhelming share of not all but most of these auctions, and most of that is foreign.  Regarding the participation in terms of number of bidders, the split is more even between domestic and foreign; in terms of the actual takedown of dollars, it does skew a bit to the foreign side, but it has been variable.  It is not the same in each auction. \n",

      " MR. SHEETS.  Your first international exhibits focus on the recent strength of the U.S. external sector.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 11, U.S. exports are now seen to have expanded at a moderate 4½ percent pace in the fourth quarter, following the 19 percent surge in the third quarter.  With import growth in the fourth quarter stepping down to 2 percent, net exports are estimated—as shown on line 3—to have made a positive arithmetic contribution to real GDP growth of 0.2 percentage point.  Going forward, we see the external sector contributing 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth in 2008 and 0.3 percentage point in 2009.  Exports are expected to expand at a crisp 7¼ percent pace in both years, supported by stimulus from the weaker dollar.  The pace of import growth, after stepping down on average in the first half of this year, should pick up some through the forecast period, broadly mirroring the contour of U.S. growth.  As shown in the bottom left panel, some additional impetus to import growth should come from a projected decline in core import price inflation, due to moderation in both exchange-rate-adjusted foreign prices (the red bars) and commodity price increases (the blue bars).  Returning to line 4 of the upper panel, we estimate that the current account deficit increased to 5½ percent of GDP during the fourth quarter, driven up by a surge in the oil import bill.  We see the deficit declining to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2009, as the non-oil trade deficit narrows to just 1½ percent of GDP.  As shown on the bottom right, the oil import bill—which has increased from around 1 percent of GDP early this decade to about 3 percent of GDP at present—looms as an increasingly important factor influencing the evolution of the current account balance.  Your next exhibit examines U.S. external performance from a longer-term perspective.  As shown in the top panel, the arithmetic contribution from net exports was persistently negative from 1997 to 2005, subtracting ¾ percentage point on average from the growth of U.S. real GDP.  The contribution from net exports, however, has swung into positive territory over the past two years, adding about ½ percentage point to growth, and we expect net exports to continue to make a positive contribution over the next two years.  As shown in the middle left panel, this upswing in the net export contribution has reflected—in roughly equal measure—an acceleration in exports and a slowing of import growth.  Over the past two years, export growth has stepped up to 8½ percent, more than twice its average 1997-2005 pace, and it is projected to moderate only slightly in 2008 and 2009.  In contrast, import growth over the past couple of years has fallen off to less than half its 1997-2005 average and is expected to remain soft through the forecast period.  The individual contributions of exports and imports to U.S. GDP growth have both risen about ½ percentage point in recent years.  This swing in U.S. external performance has been driven in large measure by the cumulative effects of the decline in the dollar (shown on the middle right).  Since its peak in early 2002, the dollar is down more than 20 percent in broad real terms, including a 30 percent fall against the major currencies.  We project that going forward the broad real dollar will depreciate at a pace of a little less than 3 percent a year, with this decline coming disproportionately against many of the emerging market currencies (including the Chinese renminbi), which have moved less since the dollar’s peak in early 2002.  The bottom panel highlights another factor that has supported the shift in U.S. external performance.  28 of 249\f",
      "From 1997 to 2005, U.S. growth was on average just ¼ percentage point below that of our trading partners.  In recent years, U.S. growth has slowed relative to foreign growth, and this gap has widened substantially, reaching 1½ percentage points on average in 2006 and 2007.  This has, consequently, restrained imports relative to exports.  Our forecast calls for this gap to narrow only slightly through the forecast period.  But this projection depends crucially on the resilience of growth abroad—an issue that is examined in your next exhibit.  Recent data have confirmed our expectation that foreign activity slowed markedly in the fourth quarter.  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 13, economic sentiment in the euro area fell in December for the seventh consecutive month, and the ECB’s survey of bank lending pointed to further tightening of credit standards for both households and firms.  In addition, euro-area retail sales volumes and industrial production (not shown) have moved down in recent months.  In the United Kingdom, the preliminary reading on fourth-quarter GDP growth was surprisingly strong, but other indicators seem to point to some softness going forward.  As shown on the right, the Bank of England’s new survey of credit conditions indicates a further level of new mortgage lending has plunged.  Other indicators, including consumer confidence, have also slid of late.  The Japanese economy may be weakening as well.  As shown in the middle left panel, the December Tankan survey showed a further retreat in business confidence, including a softening of sentiment among both large manufacturers and large nonmanufacturers.  Housing starts have declined dramatically lately, as the construction sector adjusts to new, tighter building standards.  We also see signs that labor market conditions may be weakening.  As shown in the bottom panel, our assessment is that total foreign GDP growth slowed to about 2¾ percent during the fourth quarter, distinctly down from the 4 to 4½ percent pace recorded through 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007.  Notably, the fourth-quarter slowdown was broadly based.  We estimate that growth in Mexico (line 8) GDP data, which were reported after the Greenbook went to press, indicate that growth in the fourth quarter remained below its double-digit pace in the first half of the year, with exports posting a contraction.  The middle right panel summarizes what we see as the key sources of this near-term slowing.  First, a number of countries have experienced headwinds from the ongoing financial turmoil; this is particularly the case for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  In addition, sharp recent declines in equity markets have occurred in a much broader set of countries.  The softening of U.S. growth is a second factor weighing on activity abroad, especially for countries like Canada and Mexico and many in emerging Asia that have sizable trade linkages with the United States.  Third, through 2006 and 2007, many of the foreign economies enjoyed exceptionally rapid cyclical expansions, so some eventual moderation in the pace of growth seemed inevitable, and we have been projecting a deceleration for some time.  Returning to the bottom panel, we see these factors as continuing to weigh on foreign activity through the first half of the year.  Thereafter, growth should gradually strengthen, to 29 of 249\f",
      "3 percent in the second half and to 3.4 percent in 2009, as financial turmoil subsides and as the U.S. economy rebounds.  Nevertheless, we expect that growth will remain well below the heady pace recorded over the past two years.  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 14, our foreign outlook is also supported by projected easing of monetary policy abroad.  Given mounting evidence of economic weakness and continued financial stress, we see the ECB and the Bank of Canada cutting policy rates 50 basis points by the middle of the year, and the Bank of England easing 75 basis points.  Given the persisting inflation risks, this is admittedly an aggressive call.  But we see the case for monetary action as compelling and believe that these central banks will be persuaded, notwithstanding their recent hawkish rhetoric.  The futures markets also appear to be pricing in some easing, albeit at a more gradual pace than we envision.  Finally, we now expect the BoJ to remain on hold until the end of 2009.  To be sure, there are a number of risks surrounding our forecast, most of which are on the downside.  First, the prevailing financial headwinds or the slowing of U.S. growth may be larger or more protracted than we currently project.  Second, we do not yet have a good sense of the extent to which many foreign financial institutions have been affected by the recent turmoil, and the release of year-end financial statements over the next six weeks or so could bring some bad news.  A third risk is that overly optimistic expectations of decoupling may lead to policy mistakes.  Specifically, to the extent that foreign authorities are convinced that they have decoupled from the United States—or that they are immune from spillovers due to the financial turmoil—they may be too slow to ease policy to address weakening demand.  Policy abroad may also be restrained by too narrow a focus on the recent rise in inflation, a topic to which I will return momentarily.  Finally, housing markets in some countries may be vulnerable.  As shown in the bottom left panel, many countries have experienced run-ups in house prices in recent years that are similar to or even exceed those recorded in the United States, and house prices are now decelerating sharply in a number of these countries.  Further weakening of house prices poses the risk of adverse wealth effects.  Notably, of the major economies shown in the right panel, only the United States has yet seen a growth.  Your final international exhibit discusses our projections for foreign inflation.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 15, average foreign inflation jumped up to an annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter, with marked increases in both the advanced foreign economies (line 2) and the emerging markets (line 7).  The sources of this rise in inflation—including rapid increases in the prices of food and oil—have been well documented.  Going forward, we see average foreign inflation moving back down to an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second half of this year and continuing at that pace in 2009.  Despite the run-up in realized inflation rates, readings on long-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored.  As shown in the middle left panel, breakeven inflation rates for the advanced foreign economies have continued to hover around 2.3 percent on average, and long-term inflation forecasts have stayed near 2 percent.  For the emerging markets, average long-term inflation forecasts (shown on 30 of 249\f",
      "the middle right) have remained between 3 and 3½ percent in recent years.  The bottom panels show four-quarter percent changes for the prices of oil, food, and metals.  Given the marked slowing of global activity, the stage seems set for some trajectory.  Thus, in line with quotes from futures markets, we see the pace of increases in oil prices and food prices as declining significantly over the next few quarters.  Nevertheless, we have been wrong on this score before and freely acknowledge that there are upside risks to this projection.  Brian Madigan will now continue our presentation.  \n",

      "MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The only thing I would add to Brian’s statement is that I think uncertainty about inflation in the long run could be moving up noticeably without really bringing into play disinflation or something like that.  In other words, you could be more worried about going down to 1½ or 1¼ than you were before—I don’t know—it could be more just as it was in the forecast.   \n",

      "MR. WASCHER.  Sure.  The birth-death model basically assumes that the cyclical properties of births and deaths are the same as for continuing establishments.  The BLS has only about five years of experience with the birth-death model, so I think it is pretty difficult to judge whether they need to make any additional adjustments in births and deaths, other than the same pattern that occurs in terms of net employment changes in continuing firms.  But without much to go on, they don’t take a very strong stand on whether they do a very good job of picking up the turning points because they don’t have any history on which to base their analysis.  So I think there are reasons to suspect that that is possibly the case, but I don’t think there is any strong evidence that it is, and it is important to note that they do assume some cyclicality in births and deaths in their procedures. \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  First, I, too, wanted to thank you all for the paper on forward inflation compensation.  I agree with the conclusion that it is difficult.  Especially in times of strained trading conditions, I think that is the conclusion—whether you interpret the outcome the way it was interpreted in the paper or the way I do it more cynically, I think that is the key underlying point.  I thought that was a very valuable, useful paper, and I want to thank you, Governor Mishkin, for commissioning it. My question is to Nathan on your inflation projections.  Reading through the Greenbook—even though the section on the international side is very thin—with the exception of China, where I think we can sell a lot of “Whip Inflation Now” buttons, and of Argentina, where the numbers are rigged, but even in those countries, what I took home was that everybody was surprised on the upside in every country ranging from the advanced countries, as we call them, to Turkey.  Then, if you look at the exhibit 15 that you just presented to us, those numbers are confirmed in the fourth quarter, and then there is a sharp falloff proceeding from there.  You gave us a good analysis of the risk to the foreign outlook in growth, and then you concluded your comment on inflation by saying that we have been wrong before, that there is some upside risk.  So my question is, What are the risks on the inflation side?  Could you elaborate on them, just as you elaborated on the risks to growth in the foreign outlook? \n",

If you think about the forecast as resource utilization and inflation, then it has an effect on resource utilization that is bigger now going forward in the product market.  We also see a bigger effect in the labor market, and if that were the only thing, it would have put more downward pressure—but not a lot—on inflation.  But as I mentioned, we are coming into this forecast with somewhat worse inflation performance lately, and we think that has some persistence.  So that is helping balance it out. \n",

      "MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am not sure how I got to be first here, but I guess I was being unusually agreeable when Debbie asked me.  [Laughter]  The general tenor of comments that I hear from our directors and people around the Eighth Federal Reserve District—these are the community bankers and smaller firms—is that things are slow but not disastrously slow.  The comments that I hear from a series of phone calls to much larger national companies are decidedly more pessimistic, with one exception that I will talk about in a moment.  My contact at a large national trucking firm says that they are in a 20-month recession in transportation.  They are cutting their capacity, cutting the number of trucks, and I think the numbers on their cap-ex illustrate the situation:  for 2006, $410 million; for 2007, $336 million; and their plan for 2008 is $200 million.  That is down a little more than 50 percent in two years, so they are really cutting back.  I also called friends at UPS and FedEx, and generally things are not a whole lot different but a little weaker than they have been.  Neither firm has any particular issues with labor supply.  Domestic express business is flat, and customers are switching to the lower-priced services instead of overnight delivery at the end of the afternoon, shifting to ground services, and that sort of thing.  On international business, U.S.-outbound volume for FedEx is up 6 percent.  That would be consistent with the export increases that we have seen.  Reports are that Asia is a bit slower but is still growing very rapidly.  Asia to the United States is up 80 percent, 20 percent to Europe and Latin America.  The freight market is dead—that is the way my contact put it—down 5 percent year over year.  That is consistent with my trucking industry contact—and pretty much the same with UPS.  My contact with the fast food industry—the quick-serve restaurant, or QSR, business—says the demand there is definitely weak.  They are coming in roughly flat, I guess, or actually down so far this year.  Prices are up because of the increase in food costs.  The casual dining industry is in worse shape than the fast food industry.  50 of 249\f",
      "My contact also follows retail in general pretty closely and finds that retail business in general is weak.  That is consistent with a lot of the reports that we have been receiving. A major exception is in the IT area—software.  I have contact with a large software company, and the contact noted that, as announced, Microsoft had a fantastic quarter.  The earnings were up sharply.  PC hardware sales are growing at a rate of 11 to 13 percent expected in the first half of this year, so we see strong growth in the PC market.  Consumer demand is stronger than business demand.  Both, however, are pretty strong.  The international business is doing better, in part because the industry is having some success in reducing the amount of software piracy.  The biggest problem is finding software engineers.  This particular company is running 8 percent behind its hiring forecast and cannot find software engineers.  Positive for us old guys; some of the retirees are coming back to write code.

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You know, listening to the staff discussion I have certainly come to understand why everyone continues to believe that economics is a dismal science.  [Laughter]  It is quite a dismal picture.  But more seriously, recent economic data have certainly helped feed that view, and the Third District is no exception.  Economic activity has weakened in our District since December, and to double the fun, firms continue to face increasing price pressures—not a very comfortable position for monetary policymakers.  The Philadelphia staff’s state coincident indicators indicate that overall economic activity has been moderate in New Jersey, flat in Pennsylvania, and declining in Delaware over the past three months.  Our Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers fell sharply in January.  The index fell to minus 20.9 from minus 1.6 in December.  Now, some of that we have to remember is sentiment, in the sense that the question has to do with general activity and doesn’t necessarily reflect just their firm.  But it is a sentiment of pessimism that certainly is more prevalent than it once was.  A reading that low, of minus 20, indicates declining manufacturing activity in the region and is usually associated with very low GDP growth or perhaps even negative GDP growth at the national level.  More related to the firms’ own performance, though, the survey’s indexes of new orders and shipments also declined in January, and both are now in negative territory, although much less so than the general activity index. On the other hand, while expectations of activity six months from now have moved down somewhat this month, they remain firmly in positive territory, and firms’ capital spending plans over the next six months remain relatively strong.  District bankers are reporting weaker consumer loan demand, but business lending continues to advance at a moderate pace from their perspective.  Loan quality has shown slight deterioration, mainly in residential real estate and auto loans, to a lesser extent in credit cards, and to an even lesser extent on the business loan 60 of 249\f",
      "side.  This downtick in quality follows a period of extraordinarily low delinquencies and default rates and thus is well within historical norms, so it has not greatly alarmed our banking community.  Thus far, our District banks apparently have largely escaped the credit problems plaguing the larger money center banks and investment banks.  While there has been some tightening in credit conditions and standards around the District, most non-real-estate-related firms I spoke with are not finding it difficult to obtain credit for any reasonable project they want to do, and so they have not identified largely with the credit crunch scenario. Despite the softness in the activity, firms in our District report higher prices in their inputs and outputs.  As President Lacker said, inflation seems to be alive and well.  The current prices-paid and prices-received indexes in our Business Outlook Survey accelerated sharply in expect prices to rise over the next six months.  These forward-looking price indexes, too, are at very elevated levels relative to their twenty-year history.  I am hearing from business contacts and from one of my directors, for example, that they are planning to implement price increases to pass along costs they are experiencing.  Thus, even though they are pessimistic about growth in the future, they are not pessimistic about price increases.  This adds to my skepticism about arguments that link inflation too closely with resource utilization. The national near-term economic outlook is also deteriorating, as we have been hearing, and I have revised down my growth forecast for 2008 compared with my October submission.  It is hard to find much positive news in the data released since our last meeting, and the Board staff has summarized that quite eloquently, and so I won’t repeat them.  Nevertheless, in general, my forecast is probably slightly less pessimistic than the Board’s forecast.  However, I must add that, at the same time that growth has slowed, inflation has trended up.  Both the core CPI and the 61 of 249\f",
      "core PCE accelerated in the second half of ’07, compared with the first half.  The core CPI advanced at a 2.6 percent rate in the second half of ’07, compared with a 2.3 percent rate in the first half, and the core PCE was up at a 2.4 percent rate in the second half compared with 1.9 in the first half. As we know, the PCE price index gets revised.  Recent research by Dean Croushore, one of our visiting scholars, has shown that between 1995 and 2005 the average revision from initial release until the August release the following year was positive on average for both the core PCE and the total PCE.  This suggests that inflation is likely to be even higher in the second half of ’07 than the current estimates indicate.  I am also concerned that, over the past 10 year period, core and headline inflation for both the PCE and the CPI have diverged on average about 50 basis points.  Headline rates have exceeded core rates in 8 of the last 10 years for the CPI and 9 out of the last 10 years for the PCE.  While I would like to believe that these two rates should be converging on average, I am concerned that core rates may not be as indicative of underlying trend inflation as we might have thought.  This line of thinking also leads me to question estimates of ex post real funds rates calculated by the staff and presented in the Bluebook, which are based on subtracting core PCE from the nominal funds rate.  I am not convinced that the core PCE is the right measure of inflation in this context.  Even if you thought it was, then the reported real rates are likely to be overstated for recent quarters given the apparent systematic bias in the preliminary estimates of the PCE that I have noted before.  Moreover, some measures of inflation expectations are not encouraging:  In particular, the Michigan survey one-year-ahead measures and five-year-ahead measures are up.  We have already discussed a bit the acceleration in some of the TIPS measures.  I will return to that in a minute.  The Livingston survey 62 of 249\f",
      "participants have also raised their forecast for CPI inflation in 2008 from 2.3 percent to 3 percent. My forecast overall is similar to the Greenbook’s, and I expect a weak first half and a return toward trend growth later this year and into ’09 and inflation at the 1.7 to 2 percent range.  But the policy assumptions that I make to achieve the forecasted outcomes for the intermediate term are different from the Greenbook’s.  The ongoing housing correction and poor credit market conditions are a significant drag in the near term on the economy, and I expect growth in the first half of the year to be quite weak, probably around 1 percent.  As conditions in the housing and financial markets begin to stabilize, I expect economic growth to improve in the second half of the year and move back toward trend, which I estimate to be about 2¾ percent, about 50 basis points higher than the Greenbook, I think, in 2009. The slowdown in real activity suggests a lower equilibrium real rate.  How much lower is difficult to measure with any precision.  Ten-year TIPS have fallen about 100 basis points since the beginning of September.  In such an environment, optimal policy calls for the FOMC to allow the funds rate to fall as well.  And we have; the funds rate is down 175 basis points since goal of price stability in this environment of rising prices.  To my mind, that means we must continue to communicate that commitment to the markets and to act in a manner that is consistent with that commitment.  I want to stress that while many of us, myself included, have argued that inflation expectations remain well anchored, we cannot wait to act until we see contrary evidence to such a claim because by then it will be too late and we will have already lost some credibility.  I also might add that the staff memo on inflation compensation, which I thought was very good, suggests that one reason for the increase in forward inflation 63 of 249\f",
      "compensation might be a greater inflation risk premium rather than a rise in expected inflation.  That may, in fact, be true, and I think the memo was very well done.  But if that is the case, if the rise is in the inflation risk premium, then I think it might be worth asking ourselves if the increase in inflation uncertainty might be an early warning sign of our waning credibility.   This perspective leads me to a different policy assumption from the Greenbook’s.  In particular, once the real economy is stabilized, the FOMC must act aggressively to take back the significant easing it has put in place in order to ensure that inflation is stabilized in 2010.  Employment is a lagging indicator, so we will likely have to act before employment growth returns to trend, should output growth pick up in the second half of the year as forecasted.  Thus, I expect we will need to begin raising rates by the fourth quarter of this year and perhaps aggressively so.  In contrast, the Greenbook assumes a flat funds rate at 3 percent throughout the forecast period.  Despite the real funds rate remaining below 1 percent—and well after the economy has returned to trend growth—inflation expectations remain anchored in the Greenbook.  In my view, this seems somewhat implausible or, at best, a very risky bet.  It appears that the Greenbook achieves this result through an output gap—related to the question I was asking earlier this afternoon.  I think all of us understand the very real concerns that many researchers have with our ability to accurately estimate the level of potential GDP.  Furthermore, in the recent research on inflation dynamics that we have discussed—and President Yellen was referring to this—inflation becomes less persistent and appears to be less related to other macroeconomic variables as well.  We do not know whether these changes are an outcome of a more aggressive and credible stance of monetary policy against inflation or are due to some fundamental changes in the world economy.  If the lower persistence is due to enhanced policy 64 of 249\f",
      "credibility, then it is incumbent upon this Committee to maintain that credibility.  Otherwise, we cannot expect inflation persistence to remain low. Thus, if the economy performs as forecasted on the growth side, with a return toward trend growth in the second half, I would be very uncomfortable leaving a real funds rate below 1 percent.  The Bluebook scenarios involving risk management indicate that the inflation outcome is poor when there is a gradual reversal of policy.  Better outcomes are achieved under a prompt reversal strategy.  Given that forecast, I believe we must begin thinking now about what our exit strategy from this insurance we have put in place is going to be.  How we communicate our monetary policy strategy will also be crucially important because of the effects such communications will have on expectations.  We need to better understand in our own minds, I think, what our reaction function looks like so that we can be more systematic and articulate in our implementation of policy.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me talk a bit about the region.  The Tenth District is generally moving forward at a fairly steady pace, but there are some mixed data.  The obvious wide variances are in real estate.  Housing is weak—not as weak as some parts of the country but still weak.  Also, it is interesting that commercial real estate in each of our major cities right now continues to do well.  I recently talked with several developers.  They are all doing well but are very concerned, and they are beginning to cut back on their plans and move away from them.  So you can see the worry carrying forward in terms of what actions they are taking.  In the agricultural area and in the energy area, real estate is a different story.  It is booming.  Land values have gone up in the ag part—non-irrigated land, something like 20 percent over the past year.  If you are near an ethanol plant, it has gone up 25 to 30 percent.  It is also interesting that the ag credit system is helping to fund that.  Their increase in lending was about 12 percent this past year.  That is up from about 9 percent the year before, so they are providing that.  They are also now involved in lending to these ethanol plants in a very significant way, helping to carry that boom forward.  That gives me some pause in terms of what is going on in some of the rural areas.  Related to that, the energy and lease values are also accelerating at a fairly high rate.  I found it reminiscent and somewhat disturbing in talking to a couple of individuals when they noted that the land values have about doubled over the past two or three years in some areas, and they said that I should relax because on current ag prices they should have tripled.  [Laughter]  Where have I seen that before? On the other side, actually, manufacturing in our region has held steady.  We have a lot of aircraft manufacturing, which is really strong, and some other smaller manufacturers providing support in both ag and energy, and they seem to be doing well.  Technology is also doing well in the region, especially in the mountain areas—the Colorado and Denver areas.  Engineering firms 68 of 249\f",

So it is mixed, but overall probably our region is doing better than average relative to the rest of the nation. On the national level, my projections suggest that we are going to grow below our potential growth rate.  I am not as pessimistic as the Greenbook.  I also have inflation coming down, but that is on the assumption that we are able to reverse our monetary policy at a fairly quick pace as we move through this year and into 2009.

      "MR. KOHN.  I thought we needed some insurance, and I also assumed some fiscal stimulus as in the Greenbook.  I still see, despite these policy responses, risks around my outlook for activity as skewed to the downside, and it’s because of the potential further increases in required compensation for risk and tightening standards for extending credit and the feedback on demand. Although inflation has been running higher than expected of late, and that is troubling, I expect it to ease back even with my more accommodative policy.  The combination we’ve seen of slower income growth and higher inflation suggests elements of a supply shock, and that’s obviously coming from the energy sector and its spillover into food.  It is true, as President Fisher pointed out, that some of those increases in food and energy prices are coming from demand from emerging-market economies, but to the extent that such demand is putting upward pressure on our prices and it’s not really sucking exports from the United States at any great rate, I think that it acts more like a supply shock on the U.S. economy than a demand shock.  Energy and other commodity prices should level off in an environment of slower global growth, and they’ve started to do that.  They have at least showed signs of leveling off recently.  Greater slack in resource utilization and product markets should discipline increases in costs and prices.  At least some of the reports about airlines suggest that they have tried to pass through fuel surcharges and have been unable to do so, and I think that’s an encouraging sign from the inflation perspective.  Any easing of inflation pressure does require that inflation expectations not begin to ratchet higher.  I agree with everyone else.  I’m persuaded that the balance of evidence is that they have not, despite the rise in five-year-forward inflation compensation and despite the persistently higher rate of increases of total headline than of core inflation.  But this is something we will need to monitor very carefully.  I interviewed Paul Volcker yesterday afternoon for our oral history project.  The discussion with him reminded 85 of 249\f",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Well, if that’s the optimistic scenario, I think we had all better pray.  But I think it’s a relatively balanced scenario that accurately reflects the risks that are there.  The Greenbook has done a very good job of trying to thread the needle, and I think making a close call for contraction but not actually calling it seems to be very reasonable.  The kinds of insurance discussions in both the Greenbook and the Bluebook and that we’ve had preliminarily here make a lot of sense.  Our models have never been successful at assessing turning points, and that is true whether they are the typical linear models, nonlinear models, probit models, hard to get that transition.  As many people have suggested, there are an awful lot of indicators that would go into those kinds of models that would flash for contraction being likely.  I think that is correct, but that makes it very difficult for us to assess what will happen.  So I think—as well reflected in the projections—a lot of downside risk is there. I do share some of the optimism about improvements that we’ve seen in the financial exactly what drove the subsequent deterioration.  Certainly there were some issues around year-end, but it seems that more issues than just the year-end were driving the fairly significant reversal of improvement that occurred during October through mid-November and the fairly sudden backing up.  So I’m concerned that, since I don’t really understand what happened there, I don’t want to take too much comfort from what has happened so far.  But I also don’t want to dismiss what has happened so far because it’s certainly conceivable that things will move in a more linear way forward for improvement. One issue that I raised both at the last FOMC and in our various conference calls related to some discussions I’ve had with the major credit card companies, which in some sense have a very 90 of 249\f",
      "good feeling for real-time consumption.  I’ve talked with two major credit card companies, and they both had very negative views of what had happened in the very sharp transition consistent with a switch into a contractionary state from the discussions before the October FOMC versus before the recovering, but it is not a continuing downward trend, which at least in my view provides a great deal of comfort because I was very concerned about the nonlinear break to a very low consumption state, and I think there’s less evidence of that.  I won’t go through the specifics of what they said, but basically we’re still seeing challenges and increases in personal bankruptcies, slower repayment rates, more people slipping from 30 days overdue to 60 days overdue, et cetera, et cetera.  But it’s not as dramatic a change, and it’s sort of within the range that they have been anticipating given the data from December.  Also as someone mentioned, and I have forgotten who, these numbers are still at relatively low levels.  Now, the change is in a very bad direction and certainly could move very quickly, and we’ve seen that in other recession scenarios.  But fortunately it seems, at least from this anecdotal evidence, that it isn’t a significant change to the downside, and it’s possible that it could just be re-flattening out.  My concern is still that sort of “slow burn” scenario that I’ve talked about and that Nellie and others have fleshed out on the pressures on banks’ balance sheets.  I liked Nellie’s very politically correct phrase “unplanned asset expansions.”  That’s a very nice way of putting like “oh, my goodness, something is suddenly on the balance sheet that we didn’t expect”—SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper, and so forth.  I think people are still waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the other shoe certainly could drop.  There may be things that we haven’t fully anticipated, but we know that there are still leveraged loans that they can’t get off their books, a pipeline that’s still coming on.  We know that many banks are still making mortgage loans and 91 of 249\f",
      "cannot get those off their books—at least the jumbo ones.  It’s conceivable that raising the limits at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae may help in the short run even if there may be costs in the longer run.   A number of other things could suddenly come on the balance sheets.  The example of what happened at SocGen is just another uncertainty that could be out there.  So even at a major financial institution that was generally quite well respected, something like this could happen.  A lot of finger pointing and a lot of uncertainty can come from that, and that’s broadly reflected in the CDS spreads.  About the point that Bill Dudley made in conversation with President Rosengren about being careful to say, well, CDS spreads are lower in Europe and that suggests there’s less risk in Europe—you have to take into account the reaction function by the governments, by the regulators, in terms of recapitalization, as Governor Warsh made reference to.  There are very real challenges, but overall we have seen these CDS spreads go up quite a bit.  So I think that concern about the negative dynamic scenario that people talked about is real, and that’s why it is very important to be thinking about buying insurance. With respect to inflation, certainly some of the numbers have been worrisome.  It is clear that inflation uncertainty is up.  We can disagree as to exactly what that means either about credibility or whether it is just uncertainty or whether it’s upside or downside scenarios, but I think it is up and that is something we should be concerned about.  We should carefully craft our message to take that into account because uncertainty can lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations, and that is something that we certainly don’t want to see.  I don’t see evidence of unanchoring yet, but I do see a potential first step in that direction, which does concern me.  The simple fact that a memo had to be written about what was going on with respect to some of these sharp movements suggests that it’s not clear.  Although the memo was excellent, I think there are elements in it that suggest we don’t fully understand and we need to be very careful about that.  Thank you. 92 of 249\n",

      "MR. MISHKIN.  By the way, if you know my wife, no it wasn’t close.  The second issue is that the potential for weaker house prices, which really is a significant possibility, not only could lead to lower household wealth but, more important, also could reduce the value of collateral for households and as a result mean that the relaxation of credit constraints that collateral affords is no longer there.  That could have major implications in terms of household spending, so it is also a very substantial downside risk to PCE.  The third issue is that we also see that the financial disruption has already gotten worse.  The good news is that there has been improvement on the liquidity front, and I give a lot of credit to the TAF, which was superbly thought out by our staff and has been quite helpful.  However, credit conditions have worsened.  Particularly worrisome—and something that hasn’t been discussed much—is that the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey had substantial tightening.  Usually when you see this kind of tightening, it could indicate that we could have serious negative economic consequences.  Again, that actually makes me very nervous.  Finally, to get even more depressed, there really is potential for a negative feedback loop that has not yet set in.  The financial disruption that we’re seeing right now could then mean a more substantial worsening of the aggregate economy, and that could make the financial markets have even more strain, and you have a problem.  So I really worry about the downside risks and think that they are very substantial and that we should be very concerned about them in thinking about what the appropriate policy stance is. On the issue of inflation, I’m more sanguine.  I see inflation going down to 2 percent by 2009.  The key here is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded—in fact, are grounded at a level that is consistent with my inflation objective, around 2 percent on PCE, which might be different from others’ views, but that’s where I am right now.  In that context, given that inflation expectations plus expectations about future slack in the economy are the primary drivers of inflation 94 of 249\f",
      "dynamics, I actually think that inflation will come down.  It is true that the recent inflation numbers have been very bad; but in thinking about the overall risks, I’m a bit different from the average person on this Committee because I think the risks are balanced and actually somewhat to the downside.  The reason I say this is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded.  At the same time, there is a substantial downside risk in the economy that could really widen slack in the economy, and that would mean that inflation would come down. I don’t want to be too sanguine on the issue of inflation expectations being grounded.  In fact, one thing that I think we have to monitor very closely is what’s happening in terms of inflation expectations, particularly financial markets’ views of inflation expectations.  In a sense, I think of that as the canary in the coal mine.  We are also going to want to look at expectations spreading to professional forecasters and to households, but I think information would come in first in terms of the financial markets for the reason that they put their money on the table and react quickly.  That’s one reason I think it’s very important to look at things like inflation compensation.  But we do need to look at this and do the analysis.  My reading of the analysis that the staff gave and my thinking about the issue is that there is just no evidence that inflation expectations have gone up.  The story is extremely hard to tell to go in that direction.  However, it is very easy to tell a story that inflation uncertainty has gone up a lot, and this is something that President Evans talked about and we talked about at the very beginning of a long day.  In this context, that does concern me, and it really tells me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflation expectations.  So I think that this is something that we have to be concerned about, but I do not think that what has happened in inflation compensation is that the canary is dropping dead at this stage.  But we do have to monitor this very, very closely, and again, it’s part of the risk-management strategy that I think we have to pursue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 95 of 249\n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, and thank you all for succinct and very insightful comments.  [Laughter]  I’m going to try as usual to summarize what I’ve heard; but even more so than usual, no warranty is expressed or implied.  Again, trying to bring together some of the comments, we noted that incoming data since the last meeting have been broadly weaker than expected, and anecdotes generally suggest slower growth, in some cases significantly slower growth.  Housing demand, construction, and prices have continued to weaken, and inventories of unsold homes are little changed.  Housing weakness has implications for employment, consumer spending, and credit conditions.   With respect to households, consumption growth has slowed, reflecting falling house and equity prices and other factors, including generally greater pessimism about the labor market and economic prospects.  The labor market has softened by a range of measures, with unemployment jumping in December.  However, workers in some occupations remain in short supply.  Together with financial indicators, weaker labor and consumption data suggest that the economy is at a risk of recession; in any case, it is likely to grow slowly for the first half of the year.  The second half of the year may be better, the result of easier monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and possible improvement in housing and credit markets.  However, there are significant downside risks to growth, including the possibility of an adverse feedback loop between the economy and credit markets. Reports by firms are mixed.  Investment may have slowed, reflecting uncertainty and slower growth in demand.  Commercial real estate activity may be constrained by tighter credit conditions.  Manufacturing is slow to mixed, though IT, energy, and some other sectors continue to be strong.  Financial markets remain stressed.  Credit conditions more generally appear to be worsening, and the problems may be spreading beyond housing.  Additional risks are posed by the problems of the monoline insurers.  Credit losses have induced tighter lending standards, and a key question is how 96 of 249\f",
      "severe those may become and how persistent they may be.  One offset is the ability of banks to raise capital. Core inflation and headline inflation have remained stubbornly high and are a concern.  One risk is the ability of some firms to pass through higher input costs.  Inflation compensation has risen at long horizons, reflecting some combination of higher inflation expectations and inflation risk premiums.  Going forward, a slowing economy, anchored inflation expectations, and possibly stabilizing food and energy prices should lead to more moderate core and total inflation.  However, some see upside risks, especially the possibility that higher headline inflation might affect inflation expectations.  So that’s my attempt to summarize.  There’s a great deal more detail and a great deal more color in the conversations around the table. Let me try to add a few points.  Again, much of what I’ll say has been said.  I do think that there has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for economic growth and an increase in the downside risks to growth.  It was sufficiently severe as to prompt me to call the January 9 videoconference that we had, and I think that since then we have had further deterioration.  A number of things have happened and are going on.  Very important, perhaps most important, is the continued further deterioration in the prospects for the housing market.  Housing, of course, feeds directly into the real economy through employment, income, and wealth, and I think there are some indications that spillover from the housing sector to the rest of the economy is increasing.  However, the critical aspect of the housing outlook is the relationship to the financial system, which I’ll come back to.   Consumer spending has slowed.  I think there’s little doubt about that at this point.  There are a lot of factors now that are acting as headwinds in the consumer sector.  Let me just point out the basic fact that most households in the United States have very little in the way of liquid financial 97 of 249\f",
      "assets.  Therefore, when they, on the one hand, are denied access to home equity if they see tighter credit conditions on cards, autos, and so on, and if at the same time they see greater uncertainty in the economy and the labor market, then their natural tendency would be to be much more conservative in their spending.  I do note that fiscal action may be of some help, particularly for people in that kind of situation.  Like President Yellen, I think the indicators of a weakening labor get a better report this week.  The UI claims are a little encouraging, but I do think that the weakening economy is going to drag down the labor market to some extent.  Certainly the financial going through this list of items, we continue to see problems—credit issues, banks concerned about additional losses not just in mortgages but perhaps in other areas as well—with the potential implication of a further tightening of credit conditions. Those are some of the developments that we’ve seen since the last meeting.  On our business cycle.  Others have talked about that today.  I think many of those models would suggest that the probability of recession at this point is quite high, at least 50 percent or more.  I don’t think any of us would be happy to see a garden variety NBER recession; but if we had that, there would probably be a few benefits, including correction of some imbalances that we’re seeing in the economy and perhaps some reduction at the edge in the inflation picture.  But, like others, I am most concerned about what has been called the adverse feedback loop—the interaction between a slowing economy and the credit markets.  A phrase you might have heard, which is getting great currency among bankers, is “jingle mail.”  Jingle mail is what happens when otherwise prime 98 of 249\f",
      "borrowers decide that the value of their house is worth so much less than the principal of their mortgage that they just mail their keys to the bank.  (I wonder if that 140 percent is the right loan-to-value number.  Maybe it’s less than that.)  Even if prime mortgages hold up—and I think in some regions of the country there will be significant problems with prime mortgages—there is a lot of other potential trouble.  We’re just beginning to enter the period of maximum subprime ARM resets.  Second lien piggybacks and home equity loans are all questionable at this point.  We haven’t begun to address the option ARM issue, which is about the same size as the subprime ARM category, and of course, we have the issues with the monolines and private mortgage insurers.  Outside of mortgages, expectations for credit performance are worsening in a range of areas, including commercial real estate and corporate credit.  So I think that even under the relatively benign scenario that the Greenbook foresees, we’re going to see a lot of pressure in the credit Again, our experience with financial drag or headwinds has been that it can be quite powerful and Now, the central issue here, though, ultimately comes back to the housing market.  Certainly by this point there must be some pent-up demand for housing.  We’ve had obviously very low sales for a period.  House prices are soft.  Mortgage rates are low.  Affordability is better.  What’s keeping people from buying houses is the fact that other people aren’t buying houses.  If there were some sense that a bottom was forming in the market or in house prices, we probably could actually see a pretty quick snap-back, an increase in housing demand, and that in turn would feed back into the credit markets, I think, in a very beneficial way.  So there’s the possibility that, if the housing \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  However, there appears to be a law of nature that the turnaround in the housing market is always six months from the present date.  We simply don’t have any evidence whatsoever that the housing market is bottoming out.  We have guesses and estimates about how far prices will fall and how far demand and construction will fall.  The key issue is prices, and we are far from seeing the worst case scenario that you could imagine in prices.  So long as we don’t see any stabilization in the housing market or stabilization in house prices, then I don’t think we can say that the downside risks to the economy or to the credit system have been contained.  Until that point, I think we need to be very, very alert to those risks. Everyone has talked about inflation, as should be the case.  I am also concerned.  The pickup in core inflation is disappointing.  There are some mitigating factors, such as the role of nonmarket prices, which tend not to be serially correlated.  We haven’t discussed owners’ equivalent rent in this meeting for the first time in a while, but we know that it can behave in rather odd ways during periods of housing slowdowns.  The hope is that energy and food prices will moderate; in fact, if oil prices do rise by less than the two-thirds increase of last year, it would obviously be helpful.  Nominal wages don’t seem to be reflecting high inflation expectations at this point.  So I think there are some reasons for optimism; but as many people pointed out, there are upward pressures, including the point that President Fisher made that the lagged effects of the previous increases in energy, food, and other commodity prices have probably not been fully realized in core inflation.  Furthermore, as we’ll talk about more tomorrow, to the extent that we decide at this meeting to take out some insurance against downside risks, then implicit in that insurance premium might be a greater risk of inflation six months or a year from now.  So we have to take that into account as we think about policy and about our communications, as President Plosser and others have pointed out.  In particular, as Governor Mishkin and others have noted, we need to think about a policy strategy 100 of 249\f",
      "that will involve not only providing adequate insurance against what I consider to be serious downside risks but also a policy strategy that involves removing the accommodation in a timely way when those risks have moderated sufficiently. So my reading of the situation is that it’s exceptionally fluid and that the financial risks, in particular—as we saw, for example, after the October meeting—can be very hard to predict.  There are a lot of interactions between the financial markets and the real economy that are potentially destabilizing, and so we are going to have to be proactive in trying to stabilize the situation, recognizing that we have a confluence of circumstances that is extraordinarily difficult and that no policy approach will deliver the optimal outcome in the short term.  We’re just going to have to try to choose a path that will give us the best that we can get, given the circumstances that we’re facing. All right.  Any further comments or questions?  We will reconvene tomorrow at nine o’clock.  There is a reception and dinner, optional, available in the Martin Building.  Thank you. [Meeting recessed] 101 of 249\f",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Yes, I would agree that I would not want to see that sentence changed.  I’m open to the possibility of simply changing the last sentence to go back to December 11.  Now, that clearly would be taken by the market as a signal that we were moving back. Another proposal that has been put on the table is to add something about inflation concerns or acknowledgement of the inflation situation in the rationale, starting off with something like “although inflation pressures remain.”  I’d probably end up coming down with President Stern on that—at this point, I’m not sure we gain that much by saying that.  That is something we may need and want to say the next time that we undertake a policy action.  I’m not sure it’s necessary to do so now, although if there were a strong desire to say something like “although inflation pressures remain,” I would not be opposed to that.  But I do think it might be reasonable to at least consider moving back to the December 11 formulation for the last sentence of paragraph 4, but that’s certainly a step back.  I don’t think that closes off options for us going forward, but I’m certainly open to those concerns because I don’t want to close those options off. Finally, on the broader issue of communications, particularly with respect to reversals, something that worries me is that there has been a lot of discussion about Japan.  After they would provide more liquidity or a rate cut, they would say, “Well, we really didn’t want to do that, and we’re going to take this back as soon as we can.”  So they kept providing more and more liquidity, and it had less and less effect.  It was the classic pushing on a string.  I think that shows the very important role of expectations.  So at this point, given that I think we want to leave our options open, I don’t think we want to be emphasizing that.  It’s extremely healthy for us to be discussing that internally, but until we see how things play out, I’m not sure it’s wise to do that because we could really undermine the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions.

We looked at some of the mechanisms that rating agencies have put in place to address conflicts of interest, and that is something that every rating agency is aware of.  The only question is whether the mechanisms that are in place to address conflicts of interest were working or whether they need to be enhanced.  Our conclusion was that we don’t really have the detailed information to know whether there were specific conflicts of interest, and we are looking to the SEC to provide that detailed information.  But lots of other things seemed to go wrong with the rating agencies that don’t rely on conflicts of interest as an explanation.  I think people who have looked at the question of the issuer’s paying versus the investor’s paying feel that, given how costly it is to rate these things even in the mediocre way that it has been done, it would be difficult to generate enough revenue through a pure investor-pay model.

The regulatory structure has been changed now as a result of the law that was passed in 2006, at least if you’re talking about getting the regulatory stamp of approval from the SEC to become a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  That’s now just a notification process by which, if you meet some minimum requirements, the SEC is required to okay you.  So entry is now easy whereas before it used to be restricted by the SEC.  In some sense there’s a bit of a natural monopoly going on because, if you really had a couple of rating agencies that you trusted, it’s not clear why someone would be willing to transfer from an established to a new one.  But if you were to take some of our recommendations to the next level and talk about how you would actually implement this and how you would go about making this have some success, one thing people have suggested is that maybe we should help investors set up their own rating agencies—agencies and from the issuers.

      "MR. LOCKHART.  I’d like to ask as a practical matter what weighting we should put in our expectations or even our recommendations on reform of the rating system versus the expectation that investors would actually reduce their reliance on ratings.  My impression is that many institutional investors, especially public pension funds, are notoriously understaffed.  Then they work for, as you pointed out in your presentation, boards that either represent the beneficiaries or in some respects are quite political in nature and not necessarily financially sophisticated.  That would lead me to the conclusion that, as a practical matter, they’re going to be highly reliant on ratings.  The ratio of professional employees to the volume of investment is so low that they have to choose their restaurants by stars because they don’t have time to do the tasting themselves or they’re not given the budgets to do that now.  So I’m curious about this tension between getting the rating system right versus having the investors reduce their reliance on ratings. \n",

      "MR. GREENLEE.  Thank you.  To support the Financial Stability Forum’s Working Group on Market and Institutional Resilience, as noted in the top panel of exhibit 8, supervisors from France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States formed the “senior supervisors group” in late October.  Participating U.S. supervisors included the OCC and SEC as well as the Federal Reserve.  The group’s goal was to develop a common understanding, through a series of interviews with selected firms, of how the risk-management systems of core financial institutions performed during the financial market turbulence.  The top right panel of exhibit 8 shows the 11 banking firms that supervisors interviewed.  This effort was not a complete review of all firms and events.  For example, we did not meet with Bear Stearns or Morgan Stanley as part of this effort.  Rather, it was designed to inform supervisory authorities about the general effectiveness of risk management at global financial institutions.  The supervisors have prepared a paper detailing their findings, which will be conveyed to the FSF and released publicly.  The bottom panel lists some observations about the firms’ overall performance.  Most large financial services firms, while affected by market developments, generally avoided significant losses.  Although most firms’ risk-management processes worked as intended, there were some definite outliers.  Some firms recognized the emerging additional risks and took deliberate actions to limit or mitigate them.  Others recognized the additional risks but accepted them.  Still other firms did not fully recognize the risks in time to mitigate them adequately.  Moreover, the risk-management practices varied by firm and by strategy, as did the range of outcomes to date.  I should note that the primary risk-management weaknesses observed here are not new.  They have been observed in past episodes and are thoroughly discussed in existing risk-management literature and supervisory guidance.    As noted in the top panel of exhibit 9, the senior supervisors group identified four primary factors that differentiated the organizations that suffered larger losses from those that did not: (1) the effectiveness of senior management oversight of balance sheet, liquidity, and capital positions; (2) the effectiveness of communications among senior management, business lines, and risk-management functions; (3) the sophistication, diversity, and adaptability of risk measures utilized; and (4) the attention devoted to valuation issues.  With respect to senior management oversight, as indicated in the bottom panel of exhibit 9, the more effective firms were more disciplined in measuring and limiting these risks in advance of the crisis and proved to be more agile in reducing exposures or hedging when the crisis occurred.  These firms focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity positions throughout the entire organization.  Senior management of these organizations had established adequate capital and liquidity buffers that could sustain the firm through a period without access to the market for funding.  They have created and effectively enforced internal pricing mechanisms, capital allocation methodologies, and limits that provided effective incentives for individual business line managers to control activities that might otherwise lead to significant balance sheet growth or contingent liquidity demands.  Conversely, the less effective firms were not as focused on the overall strength of their balance sheet across all legal entities and thus operated with more limited liquidity and capital buffers.  These 184 of 249\f",
      "organizations had weaker controls over their balance sheets and were more focused on earnings growth or defense of a market leadership position.  These firms did not have limit structures that were consistently or effectively enforced, which allowed business lines to grow balance sheet exposures rapidly and increase contingent liquidity exposures.  They did not properly aggregate or monitor off-balance-sheet exposures across the organization, including the exposure to contingency back-up lines of credit to ABCP programs and generally did not have in place effective financial controls, including capital allocation processes, commensurate with the business strategy.   The top panel of exhibit 10 provides additional detail on the importance of effective communications among senior management, business lines, and risk-management functions.  The more effective firms emphasized a comprehensive, firmwide, consolidated assessment of risk.  Senior managers of these organizations were actively engaged and had in place a disciplined culture and well-established processes for routine discussion of current and emerging risks across the business lines, risk management, and the corporate treasury function.  Senior managers at these organizations collectively made decisions about the firm’s overall risk appetite, exposures, and risk mitigation strategies rather than relying solely on the judgment of business lines.  They were able to effectively leverage the assessment of risks from one business line to consider how subprime exposures, for example, might affect other businesses.  As a result, the more effective firms had a more timely and well-informed perspective on how market developments could unfold.  In some cases, senior management had almost a year to evaluate the magnitude of the emerging risks from subprime mortgages on its various business lines.  This, in turn, enabled them to implement plans for reducing their exposures while it was still practical and more cost effective to do so.  Conversely, less effective firms were siloed, did not effectively share information across business lines on emerging risks, and were comparatively slower in taking actions to mitigate exposures as each business line had to assess and consider emerging risks on their own without the benefit of views or actions taken by other business line managers.    With regard to the risk measures utilized, as shown in the bottom panel, the more effective firms used a wide range of risk measures and analytical tools to discuss and challenge views on credit and market risk broadly across different business lines within the firm in a disciplined fashion.  These firms have thought more thoroughly about the interplay of their risk measures than the other firms and used a combination of different risk measures and scenario analysis to understand risk exposures.  It also appears that the more effective firms had committed more resources to risk-management and management information systems.  As a result, they had more timely and scalable management information systems and in large part did not have to create new management reports to understand risks and exposures.  Conversely, the less effective firms were too dependent on a single quantitative risk measure, and they did not utilize scenario analysis in their decisionmaking and tended to apply a “mechanical” risk-management approach.  Management information systems also 185 of 249\f",
      "were not as scalable, and there was a need to develop a number of ad hoc reports to help senior management understand the risks and exposures of the company.    The top panel of exhibit 11 elaborates on the fourth factor that proved critical, which is the attention devoted to valuation issues.  The more effective organizations were more disciplined in how they valued the holdings of complex or potentially illiquid securities.  They employed more-sophisticated valuation practices and had invested in the development of pricing models and staff with specialized expertise.  These organizations were skeptical of and less reliant on external ratings and emphasized mark-to-market discipline in their businesses in ways that others did not.  Less effective organizations in some cases did not have key valuation models in place prior to the market disruption, relied heavily on third-party views of risk, and tended to have a narrower view of the risks associated with their CDO business as mainly being credit risk and did not actively seek market valuation information.  The bottom panel explains how supervisors are planning to address the specific deficiencies.  As I mentioned earlier in my presentation, the risk-management deficiencies identified during this exercise are not new, and existing supervisory guidance addresses these issues.  Therefore, supervisory efforts will include addressing risk-management deficiencies at each company through the supervisory process and re-emphasizing the importance of strong, independent risk management through a series of speeches, industry outreach, and possible re-issuance of existing guidance.  In addition, supervisors plan to complete the work already under way within the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision to update liquidity risk management guidance to strengthen industry practices.  A review of existing Federal Reserve guidance on market and liquidity risk management is under way to ensure that it effectively outlines the need for banks to use a number of tools to include multiple ways of viewing quantitative and qualitative risk analysis, including VAR, stress tests, and scenario analysis.  Finally, supervisors plan to develop, on an interagency basis, guidance related to the management of the originate-to-distribute model to ensure that banking organizations effectively manage the credit, market, and operational risks of this activity.  I will now turn it over to Art Angulo to discuss related regulatory policies.  \n",

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  It is great to see some bank supervision people at this table, and I would just highlight one of the comments that you made about silos.  It is interesting that this morning we have been discussing issues of bank balance sheet constraints and how that would occur, and it might be useful to think structurally within our own organization whether there are ways to do a better job of getting people in bank supervision to understand some of the financial stability issues we think about, and then vice versa.  Maybe having some bank supervision people come to FOMC meetings might be one way to actually promote some of this. In terms of the things that you were talking about, another issue that I think has been important is that we’ve been talking about the effect of dropping housing prices.  I know a horizontal stress review was done about a year ago, and I’m sure Brian or Jon remembers that the large financial institutions did the stress testing.  When they did that stress testing, what was striking was that there were four institutions—I think it was Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wachovia, and Bank of America—in that stress test, and all four concluded that a housing-price reduction of between 10 percent and 20 percent would affect earnings but wouldn’t affect capital.  Obviously, in retrospect that doesn’t seem to have been a good forecast.  One, since we do think that stress testing is useful, maybe understanding that and going back to those same four institutions and understanding their stress testing might be a useful exercise to do.  Two, if you did that exercise, we’d learn something about how they’re thinking about housing prices and the indirect effects that might occur because one of our concerns around the FOMC table is that there may be unintended consequences if housing prices drop more than they have historically.  Just as the banks have to think about those kinds of stress tests and what they have already learned from the fact that they didn’t pick up some of the indirect effects, our own knowledge would be supplemented if we thought about some of those indirect effects as well. 189 of 249\f",
      "So the horizontal stress testing was interesting in that I think some of those institutions are on the good side and the bad side of your things.  The horizontal stress testing isn’t what generated the decisions—and I do agree with your conclusion that most of the decisions were made by senior management.  Some organizations didn’t do subprime mortgages at all.  I’m not so sure it was generated from the stress testing as much as a gut feeling by senior bank management that they weren’t going to engage in subprime mortgages.  I think that’s true for a lot of these activities.  It’s interesting who’s at the top of the list and who’s at the bottom of the list for a lot of these activities.  Ideally, over time, both bank supervision and bank risk management would get to the point that it’s not just a gut decision by a person at the top but is a little more systematic and that the risk-management process does that.  Are you thinking of ways that we could actually encourage that kind of interaction so that it becomes less gut from senior management and more integrated into the risk management?  I know that was kind of a long entry. \n",

Those are the firms that, again, made more-active decisions to reduce their exposures. \n",

It is all bid through the New York District, so the total primary dealer borrowing will be shown in that release.  The stigma issue is a legitimate issue, and that is why we have to be very careful about how we talk about this and take tremendous care not to disclose who or even what type of institution uses it.  But at the end of the day, if you can’t fund your repo and your only choice is to come to the PDCF, that is probably what you are going to do. Now, to come back to Vice Chairman Geithner’s point, I think that is exactly right, though.  The fact that to the extent that there is stigma, they are not going to want to come, and that is going to reinforce the deleveraging process that is clearly under way, as is the fact that they just saw Bear Stearns go from a troubled but viable firm to a nonviable firm in three days.  The lesson from that for a lot of firms is going to be, oh, I need more liquidity, I need to be less leveraged, and that lesson, from what happened to Bear Stearns, isn’t going to go away. \n",

      "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recommendation.  I came in here thinking that I preferred 50 basis points, but I also recognize that I expected that we would have to go beyond that after this meeting.  So I fully support 75 and the language that you discussed. I just want to take a minute to give my perspective on the discussion earlier about the 1970s and inflation expectations.  I certainly didn’t expect when I came onto the Committee that we would be lowering rates as much as we have done, and I thought we would be more concerned about inflation, but this is where we are, and I think it is the appropriate response.  Inflation expectations risk reminds me of Paul Volcker, hero of the Federal Reserve System.  Why is that?  He broke inflation expectations.  How did he do that?  Well, when I talked with my colleague, Larry Christiano, he reminded me that it wasn’t really by reducing money growth.  M1 growth increased during that period, and yet financial conditions were restrictive.  There was a big recession.  There was a lot of resource slack, and that was really important for bringing inflation down. I agree.  I think we’re in a situation where this is most likely a recession.  I expect that it will reduce pressures on inflation.  That’s my forecast.  I think it’s consistent with the earlier period, and it’s hard to know exactly how much it will bring inflation down, but I think that it will lower inflation.  The Greenbook is calling for a recession.  They could be wrong, but we’ve been chasing them down the whole time, and I’d be very surprised if they were wrong. I would like to know where the bottom of the funds rate cycle is.  Like financial market participants who want to know what the value of their mortgage securities is, I’d like to know where the bottom of the funds rate is.  But that is wholly unrealistic at this point.  We just don’t know.  So I would be hopeful for eventually something like the Greenbook path assumption.  But I support the recommendation.  Combined with our separate attempts to relieve financial market stress, we have two prongs going, and that is very helpful.  Thank you. 94 of 127\n",

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you.  Obviously, as I said before, we are in a very uncertain situation with respect to inflation.  We have slowing economic growth, but we have also had very elevated prices.  We had a very low unemployment rate and a very low rate of wage inflation, so we have to worry a little about whether we will get the benefits of lower resource utilization in terms of lower inflation.  But when we look back historically at previous slowdowns, as President Stern mentioned about 1990-91 and as we have discussed about 1998-99, when we didn’t actually have a formal slowdown, the Committee cut rates, and we didn’t have a burst of inflation.  Obviously, after the slowdown in 2001, the main challenge was concern about inflation getting too low rather than getting too high at that point.  If we look over the past few cycles—and I think markets are aware of those—we see that you can have cuts in the federal funds rate that don’t lead to inflation getting out of control, both when the economy is growing strongly and when the economy is quite weak.  So although I do think that the situation is uncertain, I don’t think that the markets would read a cut of 75 basis points today as a lack of commitment to inflation control.  I think there is a lot of historical evidence that suggests that it is not necessarily inconsistent with that in any way. The slight uptick that we have seen in some but not all of the surveys doesn’t suggest that our inflation credibility has been lost.  I think it is very difficult to read what the markets are saying because just look at the volatility over the past few days.  Are those TIPS spreads really telling us about dramatic changes in the market’s views of our credibility regarding what we are going to do in fighting inflation?  I don’t find that credible.  There are a lot of other things that are going on that make it very difficult for us to read something out of that.   So I support alternative A.  My thinking is actually very much along the lines of President Stern’s—that we need to take out at least a little insurance going forward.  The 103 of 127\f",
      "statement in alternative A does a very good job of talking about some of the concerns about inflation.  With respect to whether or not we include the explanation of why we expect inflation to come down in coming quarters, one of the things that changed in this version relative to the earlier ones is that there is no explicit mention of inflation expectations, which I think is right because there is such uncertainty about how to measure those.  That the uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased is the thing that we can read from what the markets are telling us.  The assessment of risk in paragraph 4, where it mentions not only the policy actions but also the measures to foster the liquidity, is valuable so that people see that these are complementary tools and that we understand how they can work together.  The mention of price stability at the end and how that differs from our statement from last time is a good way to signal that.  But I really don’t see evidence yet that we have lost credibility.  If we look back historically at when we’ve done rate-cutting in either financially stressed times or actual economic downturns, at least over the past twenty-five years, it has not turned into inflationary challenges, and I don’t see any evidence that the markets think otherwise.  So I support alternative A, as is.  Thank you \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  I think the political concern you raised and described is a very, very serious one for this institution.  Even if we thought of this ourselves before Senator Dodd and others wrote to us—and apparently it is true that we did—we are never going to be able to convince a broad array of observers that this was not a direct response to a senatorial request.  Given that, I think the perception that we included this and maybe added some other securities as a fig leaf sets just a disastrous precedent.  It would be the use of our balance sheet to circumvent the checks and balances of the constitutional process for legislating about fiscal matters.  I think that the integrity of our independence as an institution relies, to a substantial degree, on our lack of entanglement or our distance from the political fray. I would also question the value of this on the substance.  What we are doing with the TSLF, as Bill’s chart showed, looks as though it has had a big effect on the GC repo rate.  It is hard to see how some additional amount of Treasuries in the market, given the size of the Treasury market, is going to have a gigantic effect.  It is also hard to see that there is much strain or dislocation caused by the most recent observation in his graph on the gap between the funds rate and the GC repo rate—which is actually, what, like 10 or 20 basis points or about what it has historically been.  So I would question whether we really need this on the substance as well. On the other measures, the TAF is dominated by European institutions.  Term funding spreads seem dominated by the term funding demands of European institutions.  I don’t see why we don’t try to shift to European institutions the public policy responsibility for managing those situations.  We already have an apparently well-functioning mechanism for supplying dollar balances to foreign official institutions to allow them to do that.  I don’t see why we don’t limit our expansion of funding in that direction—to the swap lines—rather than expanding the TAF.  Thank you. 13 of 266\n",

But the principal reason we didn’t predict a pattern like the one we saw in the earlier part of this decade is that we don’t think we’re going to get the kind of productivity surprises that were such an important feature of that recovery.  As you may recall, we were stunned by the extent to which, even in a period of cyclical weakening, we kept getting much stronger productivity.  I think it will be years before research is actually able to shed a lot of light on why that occurred.  The part of the story that we still think was probably in play was that there had been an accumulation of technological advances that businesses were able to draw on over this period and that led to a period in which, even as growth was picking up, employment wasn’t.

As I have talked about many times before, I see what is happening as a continuing slow burn after the fires really heated up for a little while back in March.  Things have cooled off again.  But exactly as Governor Kohn said, we now seem to be comforted at levels that caused us extreme distress last fall and in January.  So I think it is important to put it into that context.  There certainly has been improvement, but it is a little early to declare victory—not that anyone has, but I think we just have to be very mindful of that. Some of the discussion reminds me a little of the discussions that we had at the end of had us very concerned.  But my central tendency scenario has always been not for a financial cataclysm, although that is certainly a real downside risk, but for a sort of slow burn that is just going to continue to weigh heavily on consumption.  I think it is negative feedback between housing and finance, but not necessarily a broader cataclysm.  I very much agree with President Evans that the chance of a significant nonlinear break to the downside is not gone but lower than it has been.  But the tightening credit conditions are going to make it very difficult for the On housing, we know there are direct and indirect effects.  We have all the signs that the contraction is continuing.  Even after housing starts have fallen more than 60 percent, we are still seeing them in near free fall.  But that hasn’t helped to alleviate the inventories of unsold homes, which remain at extremely elevated levels—although not moving up dramatically.  Part of the concern is that some of the sales may be due to forced sales related to foreclosures because we know that foreclosures are up quite a bit.  So we have to be a bit cautious there.  Almost all the measures suggest that expectations of future housing prices are lower, which is causing people to be very cautious about buying.  The anecdotal evidence that I have is that walk-throughs are fine 81 of 266\f",
      "but that actually closing the deal is much more difficult, both because of difficulty in finding credit and because people are unwilling to make a commitment now.  They think that prices may be 10 percent lower in 6, 9, or 12 months.  For many people, this is the largest investment that they will make, and trying to explain to a loved one that they just lost 10 percent of their nest egg is not an easy thing to do.  So people are being more cautious.  We also see some of this in the ABX measures that Bill put forward.  Those numbers have come off their extreme lows, but they are still much lower than they were before.  It is hard to believe that the actual default and delinquency performance will be as bad as those measures are suggesting, but they are still suggesting that things are going to be pretty tough, and so we still need to be very wary there. We are still seeing a difference in consumer behavior—people being willing to walk away from their houses before they walk away from their credit cards or from their cars.  That is suggesting that people are just operating somewhat differently from the way they did before.  The jumbo spreads are still extremely wide, as the charts showed.  We may be getting some offset from the new FHA programs and from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, but I am still not optimistic that much of this can come in before the end of the year.  That suggests that we have tightness on that part.  We also have tightness in the credit card market, exactly as Governor Warsh said.  The credit card companies I have spoken to see continuing deterioration.  We didn’t see any sort of nonlinear changes but just a continuing downward trend of real challenges and increasing roll rates of people going 30, 60, 90, and more days delinquent.  Spending is up a bit, but they usually say that’s mostly because of increases for gasoline and groceries due to the high commodity prices.  Also, as President Yellen mentioned, there is more tightening in the HELOC into trouble. 82 of 266\f",
      "I have an anecdote from one of the large companies.  A number of large investment-grade firms have drawn down significant parts of their revolvers, not because they actually needed them but because they thought that they better do it now before they are pulled back.  Even these large institutions seem to be hoarding liquidity, much as the banks are doing.  I think the banks are doing that because we still see CDS spreads that are very high even though they are lower than their peaks.  The LIBOR–OIS spread that a number of people have mentioned still is high and is continuing to increase.  That is the most troubling for me—that we are moving back to the extreme highs we saw when we had the end-of-the-year problem.  But then we had an explanation for its going away.  Now we don’t have an end-of-the-year problem, so unfortunately, it is difficult for me to understand what is going to make this go away.  I think we can provide more liquidity through some of our various facilities, but I am not sure that that, in and of itself, will be the cure.   We have seen more capital come in and help out some of the institutions.  But a lot of fragility is still there, as President Pianalto well knows.  The issues with respect to National City were liquidity issues, not necessarily short-term concerns about solvency, although I think there are longer-term concerns about solvency.  Liquidity and solvency issues are ultimately related, but there is a real concern that many of the money market mutual funds that hold between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will just walk away.  We saw this with Bear Stearns.  We can see this with other institutions.  I think that it’s fragility that accounts for some of these very high levels.  We used to worry primarily about deposit runs, but deposit runs are extremely slow.  Deposit runs are leisurely strolls compared with what could happen in these liquidity markets.  So I do think that issues are there precisely because still more challenges are coming with commercial real estate construction, as a number of other people have mentioned.  There will still be a lot of 83 of 266\f",

I also very much agree with Vice Chairman Geithner that the rest of the world is a little behind us and that the boost that we are getting right now from exports isn’t going to persist. Turning to inflation, as I think a number of people have mentioned, we haven’t seen a lot of pressure on the labor side.  As labor markets soften, it is unlikely that we are going to see more pressure there.  So that seems to be a positive.  But we do see these very elevated commodity price levels, which don’t seem to have fed through to core.  But exactly as Governor Kohn said, it is a bit of a puzzle how they continue to increase, and that certainly puts some risks ahead of us.  It is a particularly difficult time to get a good reading on inflation expectations because there have been lots of changes in liquidity issues and in other particular factors.  Some of the survey-based measures are up, but they tend to be very closely related to gasoline prices, and we know that those are at extremely high levels.  So I think it is extremely difficult for us now to make a solid determination about where inflation expectations are.  Certainly that raises a caution because we don’t want to have inflation expectations become unmoored.  But I think it is more difficult for us to identify right now exactly how they are evolving, and obviously, this will be important for us in our decisions tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. MISHKIN.  But I do have a concern about the risk to inflation expectations because of the high commodity prices that we see.  This is coming from the very adverse supply shock and the fact that we have had headline inflation so high for so long.  The good news, by the way, is that it is actually quite remarkable, given how high headline inflation has been, how anchored inflation expectations have been.  I think that has to do with confidence in this institution’s doing the right thing.  It is very important that we retain that confidence.  We have to think about that when we decide what we are going to do regarding policy. About where I think inflation is going to be—I have been a 2 percent guy for a long time.  I am not changing that.  I think that inflation expectations are around 2 percent and that there is no expectation that we will have excess demand in the economy.  If anything, it is the opposite of that.  I see the risks as balanced—there are some risks on the upside, particularly because of what is happening with commodity prices.  On the other hand, there are risks on the downside because of the expected slack and because there is some downside risk in the economy.  So on that ground, I basically have the same story that I had before.  Thank you.  \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I don’t think the canary is wheezing.  Look, I think there are lots of good arguments on both sides of this.  I think all the good ones have been made.  The we move today we risk some significant erosion of our inflation credibility or inflation expectations feeding through the dollar into a commodity price spiral.  We have had a pretty good test of it.  Over the past several weeks, there has been a very substantial shift in expectations for the path of the fed funds rate, which embody substantial expectations around a near-term cut and very little beyond that and some modest retracing as we go forward.  Expectations have come down despite what has happened to oil prices.  Inflation has come down.  The dollar is stronger on net over that period.  This is pretty good validation that the path that is represented in alternative B does not come with excessive risk that we will be eroding our credibility.  We can’t know for sure.  It’s good to be worried about that risk, but the protection against that risk is fairly good. What strikes me about this discussion is the extent of the gap in this Committee in how we think about the way to measure the stance of monetary policy.  What we could do is use a seminar and a bit of history on this.  It would be nice to run monetary policy back over the past four decades to see, if it had been set with a basic policy regime in which we looked only at the real fed funds rate deflated by headline inflation today, what the outcomes would have been for the economy at that time.  That’s essentially what you guys are saying.  It seems to me that you are basically saying that equilibrium doesn’t vary and that deflating the nominal fed funds rate with some mix of headline and core today is the best way to judge the stance of policy.  But I think it’s worth having a little exercise in it.  It is hard to look back. me, in terms of how I think about policy. \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Okay, but it is a surprising gap.  So I think it would be worth some time to think through that.  Obviously we also disagree about how inflation works in the United States, how relative price shocks take effect, and what we should respond to in that sense.  That would be worth a little time, too.  Again, it is a surprise to me.  We sit here to make monetary policy, and we haven’t talked much about this basic core question:  How should we judge the stance of policy?  It would be worth some attention. I just want to end by saying something about the dollar.  My basic sense about the dollar—and I’m very worried about this dynamic now—is that it has been trading more on concern about tail risk in the economy and in the financial system than anything else.  As I said yesterday, if you look back to when there has been an increase in perceived tail risk, however you want to measure it—credit default swaps on financials or something like that—and the two-year has fallen sharply or we have had a big flight to quality, those have been the periods that have been most adverse to the dollar.  Now, it is not a consistent pattern, but I think it’s basically right; and I think it gives an important illustration that what goes into a judgment about whether people hold dollars and U.S. financial assets has to do with a lot of things.  It has a lot to do with confidence that this Committee will reduce the tail risk in the financial system and the economy to tolerable levels.  It also has a lot to do with confidence in our willingness to keep inflation stable over a long period, but it’s not only that.  Again, we have had a pretty good experiment in that proposition over the past year or so. My sense is that the biggest risk to the dollar, since I’m pretty confident that this Committee is going to make good judgments about inflation going forward, is in the monetary policy of other countries.  The real problem for us now is that we have a large part of the world economy—in non-China, non-Japan Asia and the major energy exporters—still running a monetary policy that is based on the dollar as nominal anchor.  That has left them with remarkably easy monetary policy 135 of 266\f",
      "and a pretty significant rise in asset-price inflation.  The transition ahead for them as they try to get more independence for monetary policy and soften the link to the dollar is going to carry a lot of risk for us because the market is going to infer from that a big shift in preferences for the currencies that both governments and private actors in those countries hold.  As that evolution takes place in their exchange rate and monetary policy regimes the risk for us is that the market expects a destabilizing shift in portfolio preferences, which people might infer is also a loss of confidence in U.S. financial assets.  I think that’s a big problem for us.  It’s not clear to me that it means that we should run a tighter monetary policy against that risk than would otherwise be appropriate because I don’t think it buys much protection against that risk.  I just want to associate myself with all the concerns said about the dollar in this context.  The judgment that goes into confidence and people’s willingness to hold U.S. financial assets is deeply textured and complex, and it has a lot to do with confidence in this Committee’s capacity to navigate the perilous path between getting and keeping down that tail risk and preserving the confidence that inflation expectations over time will stay stable.  So I support alternative B and its language. \n",

Where there’s an exception, it’s like with the Bank of Canada.  They have access to information that would allow them to know with precision late in the day what the supply of reserves is in the absence of any further open market operations, and then they make an adjustment accordingly. The fact is that, even if we were to operate late in the day but still before the close—let’s say, 5:30 or 6:00—we really have no more information than we had at 9:30 in the morning upon which to make an estimate of that day’s reserve supply.  We can observe rates, but we don’t know what amount of a reserve adjustment would be needed to bring supply in line with demand.  The risk of just opening up and offering to be one side or the other of the market in that situation late in the day is that we could get the entirety of one side of the market and actually create a reserve imbalance in the other direction between that time and the close of the day.  So simply being willing to operate late in the day isn’t really enough.  You do need reserve information as well upon which to size those operations. that they have just five banks? \n",

The concept of an output gap is not really a well-defined construct for, say, China.  Nevertheless, these economies will be growing a little more slowly than they have in the past, and some of the pressures on resources associated with that growth may abate a bit.  I think that is at least a piece of the story of what you see here as the decline.  But at the end of the day, it has to be a story about commodity prices.  Food prices and energy prices have pushed this up.  Depending on exactly which emerging market economy you’re in, food prices will range anywhere from 25 percent to 33 percent of their basket.  As long as those food prices and energy prices are moving up dramatically, you are going to see rapid increases in inflation.  So the prices flattening out.  I wish I had a better story. \n",

      "MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to start with some anecdotal feedback from the region.  As you know, we have a lot of Branches, so we have a lot of directors, and we ask our directors a lot of questions.  The anecdotal feedback from our 44 directors about the second half can be characterized as subdued.  Almost all reported that they expect economic activity to be flat or slower, and I took special note that these expectations deteriorated in June after having actually improved a bit in May.   The residential housing situation in the District resembles the national picture.  Both sales and new construction are weak.  High levels of inventories are being exacerbated by foreclosures, which are adding to downward pressure on prices.  However, there are tentative signs of a bottom forming.  Our survey of Realtors across the District indicates that the pace of buyer interest are picking up, particularly in Florida, although I would say that what constitutes progress in Florida would not be considered very encouraging elsewhere.  Nevertheless, our view is that the beginning of an adjustment process is under way, but the end of the process looks to be a long way off.  Some further home-price deterioration is likely to accompany this bottoming process. Credit conditions in the District continue to tighten because of perceived risk and also liquidity pressure on our banks.  Our banks indicate that the process of deleveraging continues, which is affecting lending for residential real estate and, to some extent, commercial real estate.  We are also hearing from several sources that funding of community banks is becoming an increasing problem because of their previous dependence on wholesale and correspondent bank sources.  Higher energy prices are, not surprisingly, affecting our outlook.  Hospitality industry 45 of 253\f",
      "contacts, for instance, expressed concern about low summer bookings.  Although most tourist destinations have reported solid activity to date, few expect this to continue.   The reacceleration of energy and commodity price inflation has businesses focused on cost pressures.  Several business contacts indicated that price increases had been relatively easy to pass through and make stick in this environment.  I wouldn’t say that it’s widespread yet, but I do hear some reports that businesses are expecting wage increases to eventually reflect the recent increases in the cost of living.  This could be a significant factor, particularly in service price inflation.  This and other anecdotal input has colored my outlook for the national economy for the balance of the year and into 2009.  I have revised up my forecast for headline inflation in 2008 and 2009 by 50 and 25 basis points, respectively.  I am also assuming that the recent inflationary pressures from elevated energy and food prices will unwind more slowly than I previously projected—a view reinforced by expectations expressed by my District contacts.  Like everyone else, I am deeply concerned that inflation expectations seem to be rising and that expectations of general price inflation, reflecting second-, third-, and fourth-order effects of recent oil and commodity price rises, risk becoming institutionalized.  I am prepared in the near term to think tactically regarding the conflict between growth and employment policy objectives and inflation objectives; but sustained inflationary pressures that extend well into the fourth quarter and rising expectation readings may force, at least on my part, a more strategic look at the tradeoff. I would like to talk for a moment about financial markets.  I made a number of calls during the intermeeting period, and the growth-versus-inflation tactical dilemma is complicated further by a very mixed picture in financial markets.  My contacts all acknowledge improved conditions since mid-March, but discussion of the current market circumstances and the outlook 46 of 253\f",
      "had a sort of half-full/half-empty quality.  My contacts, taken together, pointed to several positives, including the health of the corporate loan market, improved CDO pricing, the readiness of forming distressed funds to buy asset-backed securities, alt-A mortgage demand, the growing perception that subprime loss estimates have been overstated, and some comment on Goldman’s Cheyne deal, which they believe will help create price determination for certain securities.  At the same time, these contacts cited areas of continuing or worsening weakness, including: HELOCs and second mortgages; option ARMs and alt-A hybrids; indirect auto, given the collateral value of SUVs in current circumstances; in contrast to CDO pricing, CDO squared pricing is very weak and deteriorating; the obvious concern about the growing liquidity issues of regional banks; and the view that the auction rate securities market valuations, given illiquidity, are suggesting that this market has little probability of returning to normalcy.  Overall, my contacts in financial markets were encouraged but expressed worries over still-substantial downside potential.   Let me turn now to my national forecast compared with the Greenbook forecast.  The Atlanta projections for the national economy are broadly similar to those of the Greenbook.  We have the same general narrative of slow growth for the balance of the year followed by a gradual pickup through 2009 and 2010.  My projections for headline and core inflation are virtually identical to the baseline Greenbook projections.  However, I believe that there may be less disinflationary pressure than seems implicit in the Board staff’s forecast.  As a consequence, the fed funds rate path that supports my inflation outlook is well above the Greenbook’s at the end of 2009 and 2010.  We are 75 basis points higher at year-end 2009 and 100 basis points higher at year-end 2010.  Notwithstanding the upward revision of the first-quarter GDP number and the better expectations for this quarter, I still believe the near-term risks to growth are weighted to 47 of 253\f",
      "the downside.  At the same time, as suggested by my revised forecast, I see the risks to our inflation objective as weighted to the upside. On the subject of the long-term projections, I favor the third approach, which is three years plus long-term averages, and certainly would be comfortable with approach number 2.  I’m generally dubious about the ability to do actual forecasting for the outyears, even as near-term as the third year.  So I really don’t favor approach number 1.  My experience, in the brief time I have been with the Fed, has at least personally been, shall I say, challenging from the point of view of forecasting.  I tend to think of the long-term projections as being roughly equivalent to our targets or policy goals.  In fact, the approach we have generally taken with our three-year forecasts is making the outyear approaching at least what we would consider to be the trend rate for growth and the employment and inflation objective.  So I think long-term projections really do amount to more-explicit targeting, and very likely the first question we get when we come out of the blocks—if we have this kind of approach—will be, Is this your target?  I am comfortable saying “yes” to that question and, therefore, would support the third approach.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we face an extended period of relatively weak economic growth, quite weak domestic demand growth, and overall growth significantly below trend.  I think this is both likely and necessary.  It’s likely because we have more weakness ahead as the housing drag continues, financial headwinds remain acute, the economy adjusts to the very large and sustained energy price shock, the saving rate increases, and global demand moderates.  It’s necessary to achieve a reasonable inflation outcome over the forecast period.   Our central projection has the U.S. economy growing, though at a rate significantly below potential, and then recovering gradually toward trend over the next year.  This is our modal forecast; and in this forecast, the economy just skirts a recession.  The output gap begins to narrow over the forecast period.  Housing prices begin to stabilize only late in ’09, after a cumulative peak-to-trough drop of roughly 12 percent, using the OFHEO repeat sales purchase-only index.  Net exports provide a significant, though fading, boost to GDP growth this year and next.  We project a very gradual, very modest moderation in core inflation over the forecast period.  Of course, this forecast depends on a lot of things happening.  It depends on expectations remaining reasonably well contained, energy and commodity prices following the futures curve, the dollar only modestly weaker, somewhat diminished pressure on resource utilization here and around the world, and continued moderate growth in compensation and unit labor costs.  Our policy assumption builds in significant tightening—a significant move up in the fed funds rate over the forecast period—though not as soon as the market now expects. The uncertainty around and risks to this central projection are substantial.  On the growth front, although we believe the risks of a very deep, prolonged economic downturn have diminished—not on their own but because of the force of the policy response so far—we still think 70 of 253\f",
      "the risks are weighted significantly to the downside.  The main risks remain:  the ongoing stress on financial markets; the risk that this further restricts the supply of credit, exacerbates financial conditions, pushes home prices and other equity prices down more further tightening credit conditions, et cetera; a steeper-than-expected rise in the saving rate; and the adjustment to the ongoing drag from energy prices. On the inflation front, we—I think like the rest of you—see the risks ahead tilted somewhat to the upside for many obvious reasons.  I think it’s true that, looked at together, the mix of measures of inflation expectations suggests that private agents may have less confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability than they did in previous periods when total inflation was running significantly above core.  So this is going to be a very challenging period for policy.  It’s not all terrible.  Productivity growth is a little higher than we thought.  Underlying inflation and long-term inflation expectations certainly could already have been showing signs of a more compelling, immediate danger.  Spending has been somewhat stronger than confidence measures would have suggested.  The current account balance has narrowed significantly.  We are seeing very substantial changes in behavior across the U.S. economy in the consumption of energy.  So there are good things to point to.  But in the two dangerous areas—in the financial sector and in the global inflation environment—I think things are materially worse than at our last meeting. Again, the risk of inflation is readily apparent.  Apart from the numbers, I agree with many of you who said that the alarm and concern is materially higher and materially different today across a broad range of firms in different industries than it was even as recently as two months ago.  We have to be worried about intensified pressure on compensation growth even with the degree of slack that we now see in the labor market.  Although firms are absorbing in margins a significant part of the increase in unit costs—and a lot of the complaining that we hear is about margins that are 71 of 253\f",
      "coming down and those that are expected to come down—I do think that firms are demonstrably able to pass on more than they would have been before.  Of course, what makes it very hard for us is that the pressure on resources is coming largely from outside the United States and the other major economies, from countries that are growing significantly above trend with central banks that are not independent and are running very expansionary monetary policies.  I think we are really seeing an alarming acceleration in inflation rates in large parts of the world for the first time in a couple of subsidies materially, then we will have to be tighter than we otherwise would have to be. In the financial world, although I think it’s true that the market believes there has been some significant reduction in the risk of an acute systemic financial crisis, I think we have a long period of acute fragility ahead.  We’re in the midst right now of more material erosion in sentiment, spreads, asset prices, balance sheet pressures, and liquidity in some markets.  Overall financial conditions are probably somewhat tighter than when we last met.  The financial headwinds have intensified again, and they are likely to remain intense for some time. Again, I think this is going to be a very challenging road ahead.  It is important to recognize that the current stance of policy embodies not just the fed funds rate today, relative to our best measure of equilibrium, but also the expectations about policy that are now built into the Treasury curve.  That policy today does not look that accommodative.  If you look at the Bluebook charts and at a range of measures of real fed funds rates today relative to different measures of equilibrium, policy is less accommodative just on that simple measure than it was at the most accommodative point of the last two downturns.  That said, we’re going to have to tighten monetary policy, and the question is when.  My sense is soon but not yet.  Right now we still face a very delicate, very fine balance and have to be careful not to declare victory prematurely on the growth front or on the 72 of 253\f",

I think it’s going to be hard for us to do that until we see that we are closer to the point at which we can confidently say that we start to see the bottom in housing prices.  Also, we have to be careful not to raise expectations too much that we’re on the verge of an imminent, significant tightening in policy.  It is a difficult balance.  We should take some comfort from the fact that the market believes we will do enough soon enough to keep those expectations down.  On the projections front, I have a complicated view, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize.  If we are going to change, we should focus on stuff that will change things significantly.  I don’t see huge gains from the changes in these options to our current communication regime.  If we’re going to change, a trial run in the fall is fine.  But I think the fall is too soon to change.  We need to get through this thing.  We have a very challenging period with a lot of stuff going on, and I think we need to use every molecule of oxygen in the System to get through this mess.  I don’t think this projections change materially helps the communication challenge in getting through this mess and If we are going to do something beyond our current regime, I would favor doing something slightly different from this.  I would favor at least considering publishing the average of our individual views on what the desirable long-run rate of inflation is, an average of our judgments of what trend growth is today, and maybe what the natural rate of unemployment is today.  We know very little about what those latter variables—trend growth and the natural rate of unemployment—are five to ten years ahead.  It is very hard for us individually to put much confidence on whatever the path is toward that point.  Our current regime for aggregating our forecasts the way we do, tossing out the individuals, makes our basic forecast not particularly useful as a prism.  So I would focus on doing something slightly different to change the regime, and I wouldn’t do it this soon.  If we’re going to change, let’s debate the big things and not spend too much time on things at the 73 of 253\f",

      "MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say just a few things.  First, to state the obvious—there are risks on all sides of these decisions.  Second, I will try to wade into the debate briefly on this accommodation point.  My own view is that policy is accommodative—the degree of that is why we are having this debate.  I think about our degree of accommodation as a function both of our target fed funds rate and what the financial markets do with it, by which I don’t mean just what the expected fed funds targets are out in the future but the transmission mechanism.  The degree of accommodation, as we think about our decision now and in the next several months, will depend more on financial market developments than, frankly, the decisions that we end up making on the target; and it is very hard for us to judge the direction of these economy side being diminished, I think all of us would say that there is a real chance that this will be a long, hot summer.  It is hard to know what the credit channels are going to do with our target federal funds rate.  It is not obvious to me that we should try to perfectly offset the changes in financial market developments by contemplating changes in the federal funds rate now. What I think most likely is that we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding growth risks and we won’t be as certain as we would like to be regarding financial market developments before we have to begin a posture of removing policy accommodation.  So with all those caveats and a view that policy remains more accommodative than we can allow it to be for too long, I will support alternative B and think that we have to remain very open-minded, very nimble, in our task of removing policy accommodation. In terms of President Plosser’s suggestion on “considerable,” I think the reason for the debate over using that word is in my own view that these markets are still under considerable stress, but the trend from the last statement to this statement is that they are under less 126 of 253\f",
      "considerable stress.  Therein lies the difficulty in wording this in the statement.  If we do remove “considerable,” it wouldn’t surprise me that when we next meet we will say, “Boy, it seems as though stress is up.  Wonder if we should put it back in?”  I don’t feel strongly, other than I don’t like the idea of removing it now if we think that there’s a chance that the trends, which are very tenuous, turn around.  So I think I would favor the language that you have written.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. MISHKIN.  Before the python gets it.  I think another consideration is very important.  I have to commend you on the Bluebook this time—it just had some great boxes.  [Laughter]  It would be nicer if they had a little color to them.  As a textbook author, I think they could have been a little ritzier and have had a little color, but they were great boxes.  In particular, a very important box was the one on the optimal reaction to oil price shocks.  One thing that comes out very strongly from that box is that if your credibility is weak on commitment to price stability and containing inflation expectations, you would have to tighten more to restore that credibility and get to a policy that would produce better outcomes.  So here is an issue that, with these supply shocks potentially causing a problem for long-run inflation expectations, we actually may have to react more quickly and more aggressively than we otherwise would.  This is an issue that I have been concerned about in terms of communication strategy—about how we better anchor long-run inflation expectations. So my bottom line is that I support alternative B.  I would like to keep the language the way it is currently, which I think works quite well.  But I do think that, going forward, we should not lock ourselves into what our policy is going to be, in either direction.  We need to preserve flexibility because we could be very surprised, although I think that the signal we have made that we are more concerned about inflation risks is absolutely appropriate.  We have to make clear that we will do whatever it takes, including raising interest rates when unemployment is rising, if we feel that long-run inflation expectations and inflation are not remaining under control. \n",

It is a bit risky to change, given how quickly things can move.

      "MR. ANGULO.  This is gross leverage, so it is just equity—in this case, a ratio of equity over total assets—a very blunt measure.    ratio for the four largest securities firms.  As I think you know, the SEC has made a how the bank supervisors apply it.  To date, the firms have not disclosed those ratios.  That begins this quarter, the second quarter.  For Goldman, Lehman, and Morgan Stanley, that quarter ended May 31, 2008, so we show the estimated ratios there.  These were not in their earnings releases, although they were picked up by some of the analysts in their conference calls—so these numbers are seeping out there.  Merrill reports on a bank cycle, June 30, so they have not yet released their tier 1 capital ratio.  A couple of takeaways from the left side of this page:  First, the quarter has not ended, but Merrill was obviously low compared with its peers.  They do have the benefit of seeing and being aware of where their peers have come out, so we shall see if Merrill takes some action in the near term to bolster capital.  The second point is that the investment bank ratios look fairly high compared with where the commercial bank tier 1 capital ratio would be.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  First, the assets of the investment banks are concentrated in the trading book, so there are two issues there.  Those assets tend to have a lower credit charge.  The other issue, which we have to do more work on, is that we need to understand better the modeling methodologies and the model approvals that the SEC has given these firms to compute tier 1 capital.  That could be a significant factor as well.  So at first blush they look very healthy, very high; but I think it will take more analysis to get beneath those.    The right-hand side of page 6 gives another way of looking at capital—what we call an “FRBNY-adjusted leverage ratio.”  What we’re trying to do here is to have another way of putting investment banks and commercial banks on a somewhat similar footing.  So in terms of the numerator, we use tangible equity for two reasons.  First, it’s a higher form of equity capital, perhaps the highest form.  Second and just as important, it avoids current differences between how investment banks and commercial banks calculate tier 1 capital.  Right now there’s a grandfathering period in which the securities firms are allowed to carry a higher portion of subordinated debt in tier 1 capital.  It does not apply to bank holding companies.  This puts them on more of an equivalent basis in terms of the numerator.  The deal is the same with the denominator.  Again, we’re trying to make allowances for the differences in business models.  So here we subtract from the denominator secured financing assets.  These are reverse repos and securities borrowings.  Of course, these are collateralized by cash and thus are relatively low-risk assets.  So by making those two adjustments, we have a somewhat comparable view.  The takeaway here is that they don’t look too far apart—they are not dissimilar—at least at this point in the cycle.    140 of 253\f",
      "Why don’t we move now to page 7, to liquidity?  I have a picture of liquidity, but not a full picture.  This shows the trend in parent company liquidity pools.  This is unencumbered cash or high-quality securities at the parent company of the four investment banks.  As you can see, the trend has been increasing since the middle of story because one wants to know what that pool is held against.  So, let’s turn to page 8, and I can talk a bit about how we’re trying to look at and assess this.    We’ve been engaged with the SEC and have entered into an approach in trying to assess liquidity at the four investment banks.  When we first started this endeavor back in late March, the first thing we did was to go back to the firms and to say, “Show us what would happen to liquidity if you experienced a Bear Stearns, full-run kind of scenario?  For that exercise we want to know what assets you have eligible for the PDCF.  We want to know how bad and how dark it would get.”  That exercise was pretty demanding.  No one would have passed the test.  We looked at that and asked whether a full run on the institution was an appropriate way to look at it or an appropriate standard to hold them to.  So we came up with another scenario that we put back to the firms.  We basically said, “Listen, we want you to do a stress analysis for us.  Look at something that’s pretty severe but short of a full Bear Stearns scenario.  Look out over thirty days.  By the way, you have no access to the PDCF.  Let’s see how that looks.”  We’re in the process of doing that right now.  The table on the left gives you an idea of some of the things that we’re looking at and how we’ve asked the firms to provide the information to us.  Basically there are several buckets: (1) their unsecured and secured funding; (2) what comes on the balance sheet under stress, either general market stress or firm-specific stress; and (3) the impact from operating cash flows toward the bottom.  Those are the combination of liquidity claims that they would face under stress.  The last piece is the additional funding from affiliated or unaffiliated bank lines along with, obviously, the liquidity pool, which we have separately.  Basically, we’re engaged in an exercise in which we compare and converge assumptions.  We’ve had multiple discussions with each of the four firms, trying to understand where their assumption differed and trying to converge those.  We then constructed, or are in the process of constructing, a cash flow analysis.  Again, we are relating their cash needs under stress, given these assumptions, to their available liquidity pool plus the unaffiliated or affiliated bank lines that can be drawn.  The drivers here, obviously, are going to be the mix and term of secured funding, which is going to be a big driver in terms of the liquidity needs, as well as some of the operating cash flow assumptions that firms make in looking at a stress scenario.  We are fairly close to pulling together information with which we can construct an analysis, go back to the firms, share with them our assessments of where they are, and give them a chance to explain to us how we were spot on or where we may have missed certain things.  But those conversations will happen in the near future.  So that’s basically what we’re doing in terms of liquidity.  It has been an interesting exercise.  I think that there is no simple way to look at liquidity but that this is the best way to do so.   141 of 253\f",
      " Let’s turn to page 9.  I have just a few words about the use of both the PDCF and the TSLF.  I have graphs later on the TSLF.  A graph of the PDCF usage would be kind of boring.  It would show Bear Stearns as far and away the dominant borrower.  Actually I think Bill Dudley conveyed to you yesterday that Monday was their last night of borrowing under the PDCF.  So Bear Stearns is now out.  Until very recently there were three others that I’ll call chronic users of the PDCF.  First, we had Cantor.  I’ll say a few words about that.  They started borrowing in late March, initially $600 million to $700 million.  They stabilized in mid-April at about $500 million.  We saw that borrowing coming in every night.  Members of the team here spent one afternoon at Cantor at the end of April.  We asked them for some information in advance.  We spent a good chunk of time with them.  We came away not being comfortable with the number or the size of their borrowings in relation to the firm’s capital.  We then consulted with our colleagues in both the Legal and Markets Groups.  We asked Cantor to submit a plan to wean itself from the PDCF and to submit that to us in writing.  We then followed up with a friendly letter from Mr. Dudley and Mr. Baxter asking for a little more information and a little more specificity.  They got the point.  They started to bring that down in accordance with the schedule they gave to us.  In fact, they ended up winding down to zero in their borrowing last week, ahead of schedule, and they obtained third-party financing.  So that was the Cantor story.  Countrywide was a somewhat similar situation.  They had been borrowing from day 1 of the PDCF.  Initially they would ask us for $1 billion.  They had borrowed and stabilized at about $900 million.  Our Markets Group initiated a conversation with Countrywide Securities at the end of May.  In short, we were uncomfortable with, in essence, providing bridge financing to the close of the acquisition by Bank of America.  We felt some vulnerability there.  So our initial salvo or proposal back to Countrywide Securities was that they needed to wind down the use of section 13(3) facilities by the end of June—both the PDCF and the TSLF.  They came back to us and in essence said, “Well, couldn’t you just let us go into July a bit because our merger is supposed to be approved today actually by the Bank of America board?  Our legal Day 1, our closing is July 1.  We can transfer positions July 2.  What’s a couple of days among friends?”  We had a little negotiation back and forth.  We reached, I think, an agreement that was amenable to all.  They agreed to wind down their use of the TSLF—no new borrowings.  They could swing some of that into the PDCF.  We would allow them to go until the closing, July 2, when they could transfer those positions.  In return we got a little extra margin.  So, in effect, those borrowings were being collateralized at a margin of roughly 7 percent.  We got an additional 13 percent, bringing us to 20 percent, which will bring us through until July 2.  So I think all sides are reasonably comfortable there, and with friendly persuasion, Dudley and Baxter sealed the deal there.    Let me say a few words about Barclays Capital.  We handled this a bit more informally.  They started using the PDCF more in late March, at around $5 billion.  They got to a peak of about $7 billion.  Both Bank Supervision and Markets had 142 of 253\f",
      "conversations with Barclays, asking them to tell us a little more about why they were using this.  What’s the rationale?  They had a consistent story.  They would tell us that it was economically advantageous for them to use that.  They thought it was good.  In one conversation with our colleagues in the Markets Group, one of the traders conveyed that Barclays thought they needed to support the TSLF in much the same way that they supported open market operations.  Our colleagues in Markets very quickly disabused them of that notion.  After a couple of conversations, they got the message.  They eventually ceased borrowing from the PDCF around the beginning of June.  So as of now, the only outstanding we have is with Countrywide Securities, and that should come to a close next week, knock on wood.  Again just for the sake of completeness, on page 10 I’ll talk about the TSLF usage.  First, schedule 1, which is OMO-eligible collateral—as you can see among the primary dealers, Merrill has had the highest amount outstanding.  Merrill is, I guess, the tan line.  The biggest users have been the commercial banks—Deutsche Bank is up top, a pretty consistent user.  Then Citigroup (the green line), which has also been a fairly consistent and heavy user.  Let’s turn to schedule 2 (page 11), which is the less liquid collateral.  Here among the primary dealers, Lehman (the blue line) has been the most consistent user, followed by Merrill Lynch.  As you can see, UBS among the banks was clearly far and away the biggest user, although within the past two weeks they have reduced their TSLF borrowings.  So that’s, very briefly, the top five.  There’s again a bit of a mix here.  But as you can see, the investment banks are not the biggest users of the TSLF.  Let’s turn to page 12, and I’ll finish up here.  I’ll just highlight a very near-term challenge that we face, and I think it will provide a nice transition to Scott’s and Pat’s portions of the briefing.  I don’t want to get too much into their sections.  But I think generally we have an issue.  I think that, the longer we stay on site with this effort, the reputational risk to the Federal Reserve increases.  As Governor Kohn testified last week, we’re not examining; we are just very narrowly focused.  I think that message was well received.  At this time, it’s not too problematic.  But if someone is up on the Hill six months or a year from now, I think it’s going to be very difficult to say that we’re just doing this liquidity and capital thing.  People are going to want to know a little more about our judgments and how we made those judgments.  As I said early on, I think there’s some risk to making those judgments without having a little more information.  So I think the trick for us is, if we have our traditional bank supervision model on the left and what we’re doing right now on the right, we have to move this way, more to the left.  By no means should we be way over here.  But I think we have to figure out how to get this way a little more.  With that, I will end my remarks and pass to Scott and then to Pat.  \n",

      "MR. PARKINSON.  Well, the other big category that we have been able to identify of entities that are providing tri-party financing is the custodian banks that act as agents for securities lenders.  When someone lends out securities, they often take in cash collateral.  Then they want to reinvest that collateral, and the big bank custodians do that on their behalf and invest a portion of that cash in tri-party.  Interestingly, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon are two of the big banks involved in that particular business.  So that’s another category. I think maybe what you’re getting at is about dealing with the issues of the tri-party market per se.  We have to be very careful in our approach to these issues because the situation is still very fragile, and until we get out of this period of turmoil, we first want to do no harm there.  But any solution can’t be focused solely or even primarily on the clearing banks and the way they process these transactions, although that’s part of it.  It also has to focus on the behavior of the borrowers and the lenders, and the borrowers are basically all of these primary dealers and certain other big broker-dealers.  The lenders are more diverse, which makes them more difficult to deal with.  But I think there are certainly questions about whether they’re managing their risks effectively.  If you’re a money fund and you’re treating an overnight repo secured by illiquid collateral as the equivalent of an overnight Treasury bill, there’s something problematic about that in terms of your own thinking about the situation you’d be in if, in fact, the borrower were unable to repay. \n",

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  I have three comments for the long term and three comments for the short term.  For the long term, in the tradeoff between focusing on markets versus institutions, to the extent that we can have standardized products traded on exchanges, we don’t need to spend as much time with institutions, and that takes care of a lot of the counterparty risk.  To the extent that the products have to be customized and done in dealer markets, then we have counterparty risk and that becomes an issue.  So I applaud what the New York Fed is doing with the credit default swap should more forcefully be trying to push it not only to a clearinghouse but also maybe to exchange traded.  I know there is a tradeoff between standardized products and nonstandardized products.  But if we can get things to be more standard so that they can trade on an exchange, we won’t have to spend as much time talking about some of the issues that we’ve been talking about.  Not just a credit default swap market has that characteristic.  So if we can push a number of areas in which there’s counterparty risk into an exchange, then we can get out of the business of focusing on all the institutions. The second point is that there’s a broader role for us as a holding company supervisor.  When I look at this list and look at Countrywide, it’s not because they’re a primary dealer that I would be focused on them.  It’s because they were 20 to 25 percent of the residential mortgage ought to ask ourselves whether now is the time to think about what organizations we ought to have holding company responsibility for.  The OTS has WaMu and had Countrywide.  We ought to give some thought to that.  Now is the time to think about whether or not that’s appropriate and push for it if there are going to be legislative recommendations.  In terms of broker-dealers, I think the same thing applies.  I don’t think that we should be the primary regulator for these organizations.  But if 168 of 253\f",
      "we’re going to be lending to them in exigent circumstances, having holding company regulatory authority does become important. The third point is that, when you look at this list, there are a lot of foreign institutions.  One insight that we’ve gotten is that an organization as big as UBS could potentially fail.  That may not be something that we thought was very likely nine months ago, but it is obviously more likely now than we would have anticipated.  Foreign organizations can either establish themselves as a branch or have a domestic holding company.  To the extent that foreign supervisors decide to wall off their organizations around their geographic borders and say that, if there is a problem, we’re not going to support institutions that are in the United States and you’re on your own, I think we need to revisit some of our rules on how much capital we expect foreign holding companies that are intermediary holding companies to hold.  We might also want to think about, if there’s a lot of activity being done through a branch that has no capital supporting it, how concerned we should be about that.  Should we be taking actions to make sure that, if the foreign parent decides that they are going to abandon the branch, we feel very comfortable with that outcome?  Given the list of the primary dealers, I think the numbers are fairly large, larger than they were for Bear Stearns, and that’s something that we probably should give a bit more thought to. On the short-term issues, I certainly think that we should extend the facilities past the end of the year.  That makes perfect sense.  A number of us have made the point that the markets are still fragile.  Just the announcements about Lehman Brothers over the last month highlight that we’re not yet safe, and I think that it makes perfect sense to extend through the end of the year because there could be an end-of-the-year financing problem this year.  Second, narrowing tri-party repo collateral also makes sense.  But it has implications for what securities people hold, and some of those 169 of 253\f",
      "party repo.  So we need to give some thought to whether there will be collateral damage and to the unintended consequences from that.  Third, I agree with President Lacker that primary dealers wouldn’t be where I’d focus.  I’d focus on systemically important.  That would be key players and key markets whose failure might cause a cascading of counterparty failures.  I think we ought to start with that premise and which organizations fit into that category.  Some of them will be on the primary dealer list, but they are on the primary dealer list for a reason very different from the reason they are systemically important.  So maybe distinguishing between those two would be useful. \n",

As many others have already said, I agree that we should undertake an evaluation of the changes to our emergency liquidity facilities.

Any extension of Fed authority to provide routine liquidity support beyond insured banks should be something that we consider as part of a comprehensive regulatory and financial safety net reform.  My own view may be that I prefer a narrower lending facility than I think was envisioned in some of the documents that we received, but I do think that the top priority is to have a well-thought-out, documented plan for how we move forward.  That will help us address some of the moral hazard issues that we have been concerned about.

I just want to underscore, particularly in response to Governor Warsh’s comments, that this is in effect a conditional extension, in the sense that we are being careful to get ourselves more comfortable with where these four firms in particular are on capital and liquidity before we announce an extension.  We are trying to get clarity on the ongoing supervisory relationship with the SEC before we announce an extension.  We have already gotten the 18 major dealers in the world to commit themselves to a path to improve the capacity of the OTC derivatives infrastructure to withstand failure before announcing.  We have already begun to get the resources held against default risk in the existing central counterparties higher, in satisfaction of President Stern’s general admonition that we want the system better able to withstand failure.  I think we are just beginning the delicate process of taking some of the air out of the vulnerable tri-party repos before the extension is announced.  So, in that sense, we have left ourselves in this strategy that the Chairman laid out with a little less vulnerability to the possible impression that we would just willy-nilly extend with no effort to make the system safer.  We are not going to get far enough.  We are not going to know what’s far enough.  But I think we have a credible plan to say, “We took the initiative, even in a moment of incredible delicacy for dealing with the system, to try to get these institutions and the system in a better capacity to withstand the possibility of failure.”  In that sense it’s a defensible and sensible strategy. I really don’t know what the right mix of boundaries is on access to liquidity in normal times and in extremis and what mix of supervisory authority conditions with what type of resolution regime is optimal.  I just don’t have a sense.  I feel as though I know the broad tradeoffs in it, but I don’t know what really looks ideal in terms of the mix of those things.  You can make a pretty reasonable case for a whole bunch of variance in that mix of things.  The 191 of 253\f",
      "complication for us is that we won’t be able to fully control the outcome because it is going to require legislation.  Part of the consequence of the system that we live with and part of the reason that we live with the system we have today is that policymakers and regulators don’t fully control the outcome in terms of the incentives created in the legislation for these kinds of things.  So it will be difficult for us, but all we can do is focus on the merits, think through those ahead of everybody else, and try to have the best package of suggestions that we can.   But just to come back to what we spent most of the last two days talking about, let’s not lose sight of the fact that we are in the middle of this still.  It likely has a long way to go.  It is very hard for us to know now what we are going to decide at the end was the most critical source of vulnerability and, therefore, what to do to fix it.  We don’t know what the market is going to think the new equilibrium should be in terms of the return on equity across different types of financial institutions and models.  Another reason to be careful as we try to contain the risks in this crisis and make the system stronger in the near term is so that we don’t prejudge some of those longer-term questions.

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  First, I completely agree that, once we get to the point at which we believe the best policy is to dial this stuff back and transition to a world in which they don’t exist, we are going to want to look at a whole bunch of things—changing terms, changing the relative attractiveness across the auction facilities, thinking about size, and thinking about price.  I think that will be very important to do.  It is very unlikely that the optimal path is going to be that there is a cliff—one day they are there, and the next day they aren’t.  So I completely agree with that. My own judgment is—but it may not be right, and it could change over time—that for the moment we want to have a clean, crisp signal.  Better to say that we are going to extend in the context of these broader initiatives to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter their terms and relative attractiveness.  But we are going to have to think very carefully over the fall, conditions permitting, and well ahead of whatever the new date is, what the desirable exit strategy is in changing incentives around use. However, my basic sense is not now, not yet, partly because of the complexity of the signal you are sending and the difficulty of how it will be interpreted.  We have done all this stuff in part because we are trying to address a complicated mix of things around incentives, stigma, and that kind of thing.  It is hard for us to predict what the effect would be.  Its purpose is to wean, but to do it now would make the message a bit more complicated.  If the world is strong enough that you can wean them now, why are you extending?  So my basic sense is, absolutely, we are going to have to figure it out by the transition, not quite yet but well ahead of February 15 or whenever it is going to be. \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I support Governor Warsh’s suggestion for raising the price.  It is hard for me to believe that confidence in any of these institutions depends materially on 100 basis points of the price.  It is the access, the funding, that they would be able to use to fund withdrawal or flight by somebody.  I think it sends the right signal that we view this as exceptional.  Conditions are certainly different than they were in March, when we designed and implemented it, and I think they are unlikely in the fall to be anywhere close to where they were on March 16.  You might disagree, and we could always change things between now and then.  But I like the signal of withdrawing the generosity just a tad.  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  If there are no other pressing comments, thank you very much for this discussion.  I heard general support for the short-term strategy, which means, I hope, that if we do come to ask you for an extension of the TSLF we can do it by notation vote without a videoconference meeting, unless things change. There clearly is a lot of dissatisfaction among all of us about the ad hoc nature of the way we had to deal with the crisis in March.  We would all like much more clarity about our authorities, the limit of those authorities, and the match between our responsibilities and our authorities; and, as we go forward, we will try to get clarification on that.  At the same time, we also want to take steps to try to increase the resilience of the system and reduce the risk that we will be in the same situation again in the future.  I will try to vet my speech.  I don’t want to overpromise.  It has to be done over the Fourth of July weekend, so I expect everyone to be available 24/7 for commentary.  [Laughter]  But I will generally be talking about things that we are doing.  I will talk only in general terms about some of the principles that we have discussed today about the need for clarification about how to resolve a troubled institution, how to set those limits, and so on.  But I will try to circulate that, to the extent that it is feasible. Let’s see, our next meeting is Tuesday, August 5.  You are invited to get lunch and come back to the table to hear Laricke Blanchard’s update on congressional matters.  If you have any revisions to your economic projections, you have until 5:00 p.m. tomorrow to send those in.

      "MR. DUDLEY.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to be referring to the handout in front of you.  It seems to be getting thicker at every meeting.  Since the phases.  Until the middle of July, share prices weakened substantially, and credit spreads widened.  The financial sector’s difficulties were at the forefront as housing-price declines continued to pressure this sector.  The IndyMac failure led to uninsured depositors taking losses, and this roiled the regional banking sector.  The equity prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted, and their ongoing viability was called into question.  The passage of housing legislation that provided support to the GSEs then led to an improvement in investor sentiment and a modest recovery in share prices.  As shown in exhibit 1, financial sector shares led the recovery.  However, the overall improvement in the broad market indexes was very modest, both in the United States and abroad (exhibit 2).  Moreover, no meaningful improvement was evident in the corporate debt or CDS markets.  CDS spreads have not changed much, and spreads of asset-backed securities have begun to widen again (exhibits 3 and 4).   Despite intermeeting news that I would characterize on balance as more bad than good, this news did not trigger the type of risk-reduction spasms by investors that have sporadically plagued financial markets over the past year.  Exhibits 5 and 6 compare the correlation of daily asset price changes across a broad array of asset classes in July to the corresponding period in March.  The blue boxes denote correlations with absolute values of more than 0.5.  As can be seen, asset price movements have become much less correlated.    Although the mood is slightly improved today compared with a few weeks ago, the underlying news, especially from the financial sector, remains quite bleak in most respects.  In particular, there is little conviction that financial shares have reached a bottom.  This can be seen in the unusually high volatility of financial share prices (exhibit 7) and the positive skew in options prices for financial firms, in which the price of a put has been much higher than an equivalent out-of-the money call (exhibit 8).  Financial market participants are paying more to protect the downside than to participate on the upside.    Merrill Lynch’s recent experience is reflective of the challenging environment faced by financial firms.  Merrill Lynch raised new equity capital and announced that it had sharply reduced its net ABS CDO exposure.  Investors were initially pleased that the company had bitten the bullet, and the share price rallied in response.  But further consideration tempered the initial enthusiasm—and there are more articles on this in the Wall Street Journal today.  A closer look revealed some troubling aspects of the transactions.  First, Merrill Lynch took an additional $4.4 billion of CDO write-downs from the June quarter-end valuation date.  Merrill Lynch sold CDO exposures with a par value of $30.6 billion to Lone Star for $6.7 billion.  At quarter-end, these positions had been carried on the books for $11.1 billion.  Second, this transaction resulted in a drop in net CDO exposure of only $1.7 billion because Merrill Lynch                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Dudley are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 4 of 145\f",
      "provided 75 percent nonrecourse financing to Lone Star.  Merrill Lynch gave away all the upside on these assets in exchange for a payment equal to 6 percent of their par value.  Third, Merrill Lynch’s equity issuance reportedly resulted in 38 percent dilution to existing shareholders.  The dilution was exacerbated by the terms of an earlier share issuance agreement with Temasek, a Singapore sovereign wealth fund.  This agreement granted Temasek a “make whole” provision if, within 12 months, common stock was issued at a price below Temasek’s $48 per share investment.  This resulted in Merrill Lynch’s paying $2.5 billion to Temasek, which Temasek then rolled into a new $3.4 billion share investment.     Over the past month, the troubles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken center stage.  Rising loan delinquencies for prime single-family mortgages caused share prices to plunge.  This eroded confidence that the firms would be able to raise new equity capital and raised concerns about the viability of these firms.  This, in turn, intensified the downward pressure on share prices.  As a result, investors began to lose their enthusiasm for the firms’ debt.  Investors in short-term discount notes were uninterested in taking on any potential credit risk.  As a result, issuance volumes fell, and discount note rates climbed (exhibits 9 and 10).  Some investors in the firms’ longer-term debt obligations—including some major foreign central banks—became unwilling to add to their long-term agency debt and agency MBS positions, and one or two of the central banks actually cut their positions somewhat.  However, longer-term debt spreads did not change much because the loss of central bank demand was offset by buying from U.S. fixed-income asset managers, who believed that the implicit Treasury support of GSE debt was likely to be hardened (exhibit 11).  Fannie and Freddie responded by issuing less debt.  To husband their liquidity, the two firms have backed away from purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities for their own portfolios.  The removal of this bid was one factor that caused the mortgage basis—the spreads between the option-adjusted yield on agency MBS and other benchmark yields, such as Treasuries and interest rate swaps—to widen significantly (exhibit 12).    The Congress responded by enacting housing legislation that included provisions that hardened the implicit government guarantee and, thus, reduced debt rollover risk.  The Treasury now has authority to lend the GSEs an unlimited amount of funds, the magnitude being constrained only by the debt-limit ceiling.  In response, discount note issuance costs have fallen in the most recent auctions.  However, enactment of the legislation has not generated any comparable narrowing in the mortgage basis or resolved the longer-term outlook for the GSEs.  The mortgage basis remains wide in part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have few incentives to expand their balance sheets.  Although their regulatory capital is still well above minimum levels, these capital standards are under review.  Moreover, because further losses are likely in coming quarters, it is unclear how long this excess capital will be available to support portfolio growth.  Of course, the two firms could respond by issuing new equity.  However, the low level of these companies’ share prices makes this option unattractive.  To raise sufficient funds to ensure long-term viability would cause massive dilution for existing shareholders.  To put this in perspective, the current 5 of 145\f",
      "book of business in terms of its portfolio and guaranteed book of $2.2 trillion.  Because the GSEs will likely remain reluctant to expand their balance sheets in the near term, the mortgage basis will probably remain elevated, keeping mortgage rates high.  This will intensify the downward pressure on housing activity and prices, which in turn will lead to greater loan delinquencies and losses.  The consequence will likely put further pressure on Fannie’s and Freddie’s capital positions.  So what’s the bottom line?  In my view, the legislation has helped to avert—at least for now—a meltdown in the agency debt and agency MBS markets.  But the passage is no panacea for ensuring the viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or in enabling the two firms to provide significant support to the U.S. housing market.    One consequence of the GSE-related turbulence was a temporary pickup in demand in the most recent schedule 1 TSLF auction, on July 25 (exhibit 13).  As term mortgage agency repo spreads widened relative to term Treasury repo rates, the cost of borrowing via the TSLF became more attractive.  This illustrates how the TSLF program can act as a shock absorber and reduce volatility in term repo rates.  With the exception of the July 25 auction, the TSLF auctions continue to be undersubscribed with relatively stable bid-to-cover ratios.  In contrast to the turbulence evident in the financial sector, the bank term funding exhibits 14 and 15, the spreads of one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR to OIS remain elevated in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.  However, this masks the fact that forward funding rates appear to have risen significantly.  As shown in exhibit 16, the forward three-month LIBOR–OIS spread has risen about 20 basis points over the past three months.  This spread is now anticipated to remain elevated at around 50 basis points on a one-to-two-year time horizon, indicating that Before the crisis, the spread was about 10 basis points.  The U.S. TAF auctions also show a stable trend.  As shown in exhibit 17, the bid-to-cover ratio remains around 1.2 to 1, and the stop-out rate has been quite steady over the past five auctions.  In contrast, as shown in exhibit 18, the bid-to-cover ratio for the ECB dollar auction continues to climb.  As I noted in an earlier briefing, part of this rise reflects the fact that the ECB auction is noncompetitive.  The bids are prorated, and the banks pay the U.S stop-out rate.  Larger bids by European banks in the ECB auction do not affect the interest rate they pay for such funding, and that encourages more-aggressive bidding.  Conversations with the ECB staff indicate that they are concerned that the outcome could be a bidding spiral.  Individual banks could keep raising the size of their bid submissions to ensure a stable amount of dollar funding.  It is possible that these pressures could eventually encourage the ECB to switch to a Swiss National Bank type of multiple-price auction.  This would eliminate the incentives to bid more and more aggressively on the part of the European banks.  However, such a change probably would result in a higher stop-out rate in the ECB auctions compared with the United States or Switzerland.  ECB officials might not be fully comfortable with such an outcome.    6 of 145\f",
      " Early reactions by primary dealers and depository institutions to the two refinements to our liquidity facilities—the $50 billion program of options on the TSLF and the introduction of the longer, 84-day, maturity TAF auctions—have been favorable.  We recently—last Friday and this Monday—completed an extensive set of interviews with the primary dealer community about the TSLF options program and will be proposing final terms, within the set of parameters approved by the FOMC on forward on this.    As you know, our liquidity facilities have placed significant demands on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, as the Chairman mentioned.  As the liquidity facilities have been expanded, we have reduced the size of our Treasury portfolio.  We do this to drain the reserves added by our liquidity programs.  The use of our balance sheet to sterilize these reserve additions has raised questions about whether sufficient capacity is still available to meet prospective demand—especially a large unanticipated rise in PDCF or PCF borrowing.  Exhibit 19 illustrates the transformation of the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet over the past year, out of Treasuries into non-Treasury lending.  As shown in exhibit 20, the non-Treasury portion consists mainly of $150 billion of TAF loans, the $62 billion (in steady state) of foreign exchange swaps executed with the ECB and the SNB, and our $80 billion 28-day maturity, single-tranche repo program.  Although the amount of Treasuries held in the SOMA portfolio still totals $479 billion, a majority of these securities are encumbered in one way or another.  As shown in exhibit 21, from that $479 billion we need to allocate $45 billion of Treasuries to collateralize the foreign central bank repo pool, retain $35 billion of on-the-run Treasury securities to keep available for our traditional Treasury securities lending program, and set aside $175 billion for the TSLF program and now an additional $50 billion for the TSLF options program (TOP).  When the options program is included, we have about $174 billion of unencumbered Treasuries available to offset additional PCF and PDCF borrowing or to fund further expansion of our liquidity programs.  Obviously, further expansion of our TAF or TSLF auctions or single-tranche repo operations would be at our discretion and, thus, does not pose a meaningful problem in terms of reserve management.  We wouldn’t expand these programs if we didn’t have the ability to conduct offsetting reserve draining operations.  However, what would we do if faced with a huge rise in PCF or PDCF borrowing?  An inability to drain the reserves added by such lending would cause the federal funds rate to collapse below the target.  Fortunately, we have a number of alternatives that would enable us to offset very large demands for PCF or PDCF borrowing.  First, we could sell our remaining unencumbered Treasury holdings or use them to engage in reverse repo operations with the primary dealer community.  This could be augmented by the $35 billion of on-the-run Treasury securities currently set aside for securities lending.  Together, these two sources could be used to drain more than $200 billion of reserves.  Second, we have made arrangements with the Treasury so that, if the need arises, the Treasury would issue special Treasury bills into the market on our behalf and take the proceeds 7 of 145\f",
      "and deposit them at the Federal Reserve.  Putting the proceeds of such T-bill sales on the Fed’s balance sheet would drain reserves from the banking system.  The potential scope here is large.  The housing legislation raised the debt limit substantially.  There is now about $1.2 trillion of headroom under the debt limit compared with only about $400 billion previously.  Third, we continue to press for legislation that would accelerate the timing of the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on reserves.  Being able to pay interest on reserves would put a floor under the federal funds rate.  In this case, an inability to drain additional reserves from the banking system would not result in the federal funds rate collapsing toward zero.  Finally, we continue to explore the legal and operational feasibility of expanding our balance sheet in other ways.  For example, could we engage in reverse repurchase transactions using the collateral obtained from our single-tranche repo and from our TSLF operations?   I wouldn’t say I am confident that we can handle any eventuality—after all, the triparty repo system provides trillions of dollars of funding to the primary dealers.  In the unlikely event that it all came to us, we wouldn’t have the capacity to fully offset it at present.  But we could accommodate hundreds of billions of dollars of demand if that proved to be necessary.  That said, I want to go on record that any very large unanticipated demand for funding from the Federal Reserve by dealers or depository institutions might take a few days or more to offset by reserve-draining operations.  Thus, in such a circumstance, the federal funds rate could temporarily trade below its target.    Turning now to interest rate expectations, monetary policy expectations have reverted back to the very slow path toward tightening that was evident before the Eurodollar futures curves have shifted down sharply since the June FOMC meeting.  Our current survey of the primary dealers shows an even slower anticipated pace of tightening.  As shown in exhibit 24, the average of the dealer forecasts in our most recent survey anticipates no tightening until the second quarter of 2009.  But the change in the dealers’ forecasts since the June FOMC meeting is more modest than the shift in market expectations (compare exhibits 24 and 25).  Looking at the probabilities of different rate outcomes implied by options on federal funds rate futures in exhibits 26 and 27, one sees that there has been a steady trend upward in the probability that the FOMC will keep its policy target rate unchanged at both the by market participants to further easing is lower than the probability assigned to tightening.    The past month has been marked by a significant decline in commodity prices.  As shown in exhibit 28, although the energy complex has led the way down, agriculture and industrial metals prices have also declined significantly.  These spread of nominal Treasury and TIPS yields (exhibit 29).  As shown in exhibit 30, longer-term market-based indicators of inflation expectations have increased a bit.

      "MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was advised to speak of things I know, so all of my comments will have to do with commercial banks and the traditional banking operations within those banks.  Also, they are limited to the market area that I operated in.  I was in a large community bank.  The primary competitors were 2 of the top 5 banks and 4 of the top 20 banks.  I hope to expand that on the supervision committee. I guess the major observation I would have is that I can’t see lending growth ever resuming until the market for financial stocks improves.  That market is not going to improve until it is clear that the credit risk is manageable.  I haven’t seen the confidence in banking and banking institutions this low since we were well into the S&L crisis back in the early 1990s.  At the same time, the credit numbers—or at least the commercial banks’ part of the credit numbers—don’t look all that bad.  At this point, we are sharing those credit losses with a number of other types of institutions, and I think the banks got the better slice of that pie.  So I do believe that the banks will be able to manage through this. On the equity side of things, you have had equity destroyed through credit losses, and so those banks are certainly reducing their lending.  I don’t think there is enough capital in the system.  I don’t think earnings are strong enough.  There is certainly no external capital available to pick up that slack.  So while you hear smaller banks say, “We are getting great business now because the larger banks have cut back on their lending,” they just don’t have the capacity to take in that business.  No matter why they are trying to raise capital, capital issuance is viewed as a sign of weakness.  It is scarce.  It is expensive.  The short selling has been just amazing.  It has really driven down the prices.  For some of the larger banks, it is running anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of total float.  It has even gotten down into banks smaller than $5 billion.  I was looking at one, and the short interest on July 15 was 10 times that of April 15.  It was running 93 of 145\f",
      "about 7 percent of float on a very thinly traded stock.  I can’t believe that it has anything to do with the fundamentals of the institution.  It is just all being painted with the same brush. For institutions that must raise capital or fail, my concern is that the capital that is being raised or being offered comes with an exit strategy.  I don’t think that the capital is going to have the patience to wait for a longer-term resumption of lending.  Those that do have capital cushions seem to be spending them on small buybacks or dividend increases in an effort to demonstrate some confidence in the future. On the liquidity side, central core funding is very tight and incredibly uncertain.  CD rates do remain high, and as one institution after another desperately needs money, they raise the rates.  As one falls out of that situation, somebody else picks it up again.  After the full weekend of IndyMac coverage in the press, the phones just lit up everywhere asking about FDIC insurance.  Now there is a renewed interest in the CDARS program.  I didn’t realize that these deposits are classified as brokered deposits.  It will be interesting to see if we have a big jump in brokered deposits in the next couple of quarters.  The Home Loan Banks are tightening their collateral requirements.  They are introducing risk rating systems, so that source of funding is not as available as it was.  Nonconforming mortgages are impossible to place.   On the asset side, I talked to several correspondent bankers, and they have been told to cut their overall fed funds lines sometimes in half.  It doesn’t matter who it is, just cut them in half.  A number of the banks are cutting home equity lines across the board and freezing those lines.  The full-relationship lending is prized, but even in that it is only to the extent that lending is in some ways self funding.  Transaction deals are like hot potatoes; nobody wants to touch them. 94 of 145\f",
      "We had some calls from other bankers who were asking what liquidity premium we were adding to our pricing, so there is clearly a change in the pricing, which may actually improve profitability.  However, I think a lot of it is in order not to turn down the credit but simply to price out the credit, so that the borrower makes the decision not to borrow rather than the bank making the decision not to lend. On the credit side, the reserve additions have been incredibly dramatic, but a lot of that is because reserve levels were so low going into this.  Capital was strong, earnings were strong, but reserve levels were down at 70 or 80 basis points.  I had not ever seen them below 1 percent until two or three years ago.  That is because of the change in the accounting for reserves as well as 10 years of no demonstrable losses.  Oddly enough, the charge-off and delinquency rates really don’t look all that bad.  When I looked at first-quarter rates, they didn’t look a whole lot different from what used to be the norm, at least in terms of commercial loans.  Then, on the consumer side, in this case it was mortgage loans versus consumer loans, but still a 75 basis point loss on consumer loans historically was actually normal. It is really difficult to follow any discussion of what is going on in terms of credit losses because you get confused between what is mark-to-market loss, what is actual credit loss, what are charge-offs, what are reserves, and then who owns those losses.  I am not quite sure what the rate of deterioration or the rate of resolution is.  In terms of collection, it takes an awful lot of time to ramp up collection and recovery efforts, and I don’t know where we are in that cycle, but I think we have a long way to go. The last cycle was all about commercial real estate, and nobody could work up much sympathy for commercial real estate developers.  [Laughter]  In this situation, there is so much political sensitivity around foreclosures that I think it is going to be much elongated.  When a 95 of 145\f",
      "borrower cannot or will not pay and you can’t restructure it to create capacity or willingness to pay, then some form of forced sale is the only thing that gets you off go.  I think that has been pushed out and pushed out.  It is also the only way to clear any junior liens.  This process is expensive and time-consuming, and owning the property is even more expensive.  So as the lender-owned properties become a larger and larger segment of the properties for sale, I do think price declines are going to accelerate significantly.   I will be watching the IndyMac resolution particularly closely.  In the last cycle, if you will remember, the properties that were sold by the RTC brought the biggest discounts of all.  So it will be interesting to see what this theory of holding off on foreclosures and then at some later point having to move the assets actually does to prices.  The good news is that once lenders start selling, they do tend to move units at whatever price it takes.  Lenders are going to have to do that.  There is no justification for wasting precious capital or liquidity on dead assets.  But there is also no justification for selling the portfolios at fire sale prices if the net realizable value of collecting them is higher, and I think it definitely is for the banks. Finally, if I could take one more minute, I did do some very in-depth personal research on the housing decisions of a relocating worker.  [Laughter]  I purchased a residence in January ’06 for a May ’06 closing and hit the peak.  The current value, I am told, is 80 to 85 percent of the purchase price, marketing time 6 to 12 months.  The purchase in the new location—I did do the calculation—it was 15 to 20 times annual rent, but that didn’t matter.  I had already had all the thrill of ownership that I could stand and will be renting.  [Laughter]  The second thing is that, if I had financed this property at 80 percent, I would have had no equity to roll into a new purchase anyway, so there would have been no decision involved.  The good news is that as long as there is no need to sell, the price doesn’t matter, and I could have waited it out very easily.  So the 96 of 145\f",
      "conclusion that I came to is that this current elevated inventory we have of housing includes only those who absolutely have to sell because nobody in this market would choose to sell.  So once that begins to turn around, again, there just have to be a whole lot of pent-up houses for sale.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support keeping the federal funds rate at 2 percent for now.  I think that is consistent with bringing inflation down over time.  I agree that we’re going to have to tighten at some point.  I agree with your analysis, Mr. Chairman—I don’t think we have a highly accommodative policy right now.  Not only would I cite the interest rates that you cited, but I would cite the behavior of households and businesses, which aren’t acting as if they’re looking at very low real interest rates by making purchases of durable goods, capital equipment, et cetera.  The cost of capital is not perceived to be low right now, and I think it’s for the reasons you cited. In my view, over the intermeeting period the inflation risks have narrowed just a bit.  The damper on inflation risk comes from the decline in oil and commodity prices, the steadiness of the dollar, and my perception that we can count on a more negative output gap going forward, which will provide some discipline on prices and wages.  This is a difficult situation.  There are no ideal outcomes when you have this change in relative prices.  We will have to live with higher inflation and higher unemployment temporarily.  We have to keep our eye on the second-round effects, not just the pass-throughs but the spillovers, and I think so far so good.  That’s a tenuous situation, I agree, but my read of the incoming information is that we can be a little more patient than we thought we could be six or seven weeks ago. As for the wording of the statement, I could live with President Yellen’s rewording, but I think that this language Brian suggested is okay as well.  I’m actually not sure how the markets will react to this.  Some of the commentary I read over the last couple of weeks thought that we were tilted toward inflation last time because of the way we worded things.  I don’t think that the market reaction will be large to this, and I agree that the first choice would be not to change market 112 of 145\f",

      "MR. LACKER.  In the interest of avoiding talking past each other, let me say a bit about why I view real rates as low.  I recognize what you and Governor Kohn said about other interest rates.  But when I look at the low real rate now and at times in the past when it has been low and I look at things like corporate borrowing rates then, they didn’t fall nearly as much as the fed funds rate.  If you plot them by lining up the NBER dates, it doesn’t look as though what’s happened now with those borrowing rates is out of line with past experiences.  So if we think now that real rates were low in ’03, I’m led to conclude that I ought to think that they are low currently.  Another way of saying this is that spreads always go up in recessions.  We drive real rates down in recessions.  If consumers and businesses were spending with frenzy now because of low rates, to me that would be a reason that we have to raise them, get them up right away.  You know, my sense of the economics of why we push real rates low in recessions is that the state of aggregate demand needs it.  It’s exactly when consumer and business spending is sort of moribund that we have real rates low.  I’m not sure that the fact that it’s moribund tells me whether they’re low or not relative to where they ought to be.  That’s how I think about that evidence, but I look forward to being enlightened further in the future on this. \n",

      "MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just let me talk a little about monetary policy, and I’ll be brief there.  But then I have to use my opportunity to raise some issues for the Committee when I’m not here.  I do support alternative B.  As is obvious from my earlier discussion, I believe that the risks are balanced.  I have one modification to Janet’s language because I think it is just simpler to say that “the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of concern to the Committee.”  I don’t see the need for “both,” but we’re actually on the same wavelength in terms of this issue. What I’d like to spend some time on—because I feel this is sort of my swan song, but have for this Committee going forward.  I’m not going to be able to participate, but I have a chance now to lay them out.  The first is the real danger of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as reflecting the stance of monetary policy.  This is very dangerous.  I want to talk about that.  Second is that I think it’s absolutely critical that we keep our options open in the current circumstances, and so I want to talk about that.  The third is on the communication issue, but it’s not going to be on inflation objectives.  I’ve already talked about that enough in public, so it’s clear to you one way or the other.  I hope you consider it, but that’s something that I don’t need to go into here. First of all, let me talk about the issue of focusing too much on the federal funds rate as indicating the stance of monetary policy.  This is something that’s very dear to my heart.  I have a chapter in my textbook that deals with this whole issue and talks about the very deep mistakes that have been made in monetary policy because of exactly that focus on the short-term interest rate as indicating the stance of monetary policy.  In particular, when you think about the stance of monetary policy, you should look at all asset prices, which means look at all interest rates.  All asset prices have a very important effect on aggregate demand.  Also you should look at credit market 121 of 145\f",
      "conditions because some things are actually not reflected in market prices but are still very important.  If you don’t do that, you can make horrendous mistakes.  The Great Depression is a classic example of when they made two mistakes in looking at the policy interest rate.  One is that they didn’t understand the difference between real and nominal interest rates.  That mistake I’m not worried about here.  People fully understand that.  But it is an example when nominal rates went down, but only on default-free Treasury securities; in fact, they skyrocketed on other ones.  The stance of monetary policy was incredibly tight during the Great Depression, and we had a disaster.  The Japanese made the same mistake, and I just very much hope that this Committee does not make this mistake because I have to tell you that the situation is scary to me.  I’m holding two houses right now.  I’m very nervous.  [Laughter] The second issue is that it’s absolutely critical that we keep our options open.  This relates to the points that I already made in my discussion—I argued that we don’t know where this situation of financial stress is actually going to head and that the potential for shoes dropping and bad things happening out there is real.  I think it’s likely that it won’t happen, but it’s a significant probability with very serious negative consequences.  In that situation, we don’t know exactly the direction of where we have to go.  I was actually very pleased with President Evans’s comments.  Charlie has been a good friend for a long time, and he is one of the people I have tremendous respect for as an economist.  Although we had a disagreement in our view of monetary policy today, on the issue going forward I was pleased to see that you actually indicated that there is a possibility—we hope it doesn’t happen, by the way—that things go south and that we actually have to be much more aggressive on monetary policy and on liquidity issues.  I know that there have been some concerns on the Committee about that as well, but no option should be taken off the table if bad things happen, and we cannot get boxed in.  I feel very, very strongly about that.   122 of 145\f",
      "I would also say that the same issue comes up in terms of inflation.  I have argued very strenuously for nongradualism in a situation like the one we’re in.  We are in a different world when we are in a situation of financial stress, and it’s very possible that we might have to raise rates very quickly.  There’s a good news case and a bad news case.  The good news case is that housing prices stabilize.  That could actually turn things around very quickly.  I think, Bill, if I’m not incorrect, you mentioned that possibility, and I think you’re absolutely right.  In that kind of situation, our policy would become very accommodative.  I do not think it’s too accommodative at all right now.  I think it’s balanced; it’s appropriate.  But if the financial markets improve, it will become much too accommodative very quickly, and we then have to respond very quickly in order not to have inflationary consequences.  I’d like to see that happen, by the way. The other case, which I would not like to see happen, is that inflation expectations get unhinged.  I have seen no evidence that long-run inflation expectations have gotten unhinged, but there is substantial risk.  If that happened, we would also have to move up very quickly.  So I really implore this Committee to keep your options open.  Do not get boxed in.  Let’s hope and pray—let’s all get around in a circle and hold hands—that oil prices fall, which will also help us not get boxed in.  Don, I told you I was going to be a little colorful.  He was waiting for this one.  I should mention that Don was actually at a conference where he talked about constraints on people’s behavior as a result of the transcripts being recorded, and he said, “But not Rick.”  [Laughter] The third issue is something about which I am less constrained, which is communications.  I would not have talked about this earlier, but it really does worry me.  We have a complicated governance structure in this Committee, which I actually think is the right governance structure.  We have two types of groups that vote on this Committee.  We have the people who are Presidential appointees and then confirmed by the Senate, who are Board members, and I will soon not be one of 123 of 145\f",
      "them.  I’ll be a civilian again.  Then we have Bank presidents, who are much more tied into the private sector because your boards of directors, which are composed of private-sector people, recommend you.  Then we do have some role, but they’re the primary people who decide who becomes a Bank president. I think that’s a very good framework.  It actually serves us very well.  I’ve been on both sides.  I’ve been on the other side of the fence, not as a president but as an executive vice president.  It serves us very well because we have a link to the private sector that we normally would not have; importantly, it keeps us real in terms of information; and there’s a group of people out there who are not in Washington or New York (because people also have a hard time about New York) but who tend to be very important supporters for us politically.  So this is a system that I would very much like to see preserved.  It does have a problem because of the different roles here.  What I have been very concerned about—and I have had people in the markets speak to me about this—is that recently I had a very prominent central bank governor say to me, “What in the hell are you guys doing?”  The issue here is that we need to have a situation where Bank presidents and also members of the Board can speak their views.  They may have different views, and I very much encourage that in terms of discussion, of where they think the economy is going, which is what we do inside; and I think that does need to be done outside the Committee because it shows that there are different views, that we’re thinking about it, that we’re trying to learn from each other, and so forth and so on.  What is very problematic from my viewpoint are the speeches, discussions, and interviews outside, when people talk about where they think interest rates should head and where the policy rate should head.  That’s where the criticism has been coming from.  I have to tell you that a lot of people whom I respect tremendously are saying to me that it’s making us look like the gang that can’t shoot straight.  I think it’s a really serious problem.  I understand that we want to keep the 124 of 145\f",
      "priority of speaking our minds, but we have to work as a team, and I think that we’re having a problem in this regard.   Let me talk about why I think this is dangerous.  It’s dangerous in terms of policy setting.  You can see this is very blunt.  Clearly, if you were in a multi-period game, you wouldn’t be this blunt.  But now I’m not going to be here anymore, so you can hate me—I don’t care.  [Laughter]  But this kind of cacophony on this issue has the potential to damage us in two very serious ways.  One is that it weakens the confidence in our institution, and I have to tell you that I love this institution.  It’s very hard for me to leave this place, but it’s something I have to do.  If the institution is damaged in terms of the confidence that the public and the politicians have in us, it will hurt us deeply.  It will hurt us in terms of policy because it will weaken our credibility, which actually will make it harder to control inflation.  So I consider this a very serious cost.  The second issue is on the political front.  It is very possible that we’re going to have a reopening of the Federal Reserve Act with the next Administration and the next Congress.  The reason I think it is possible is that we have to restructure our regulatory structure.  There’s no way to get around it—we are in a brave new world on this.  That could lead to an opening of this issue.  The problem here is, in that opening, there are a lot of people in the Congress who are very uncomfortable having policymakers who are not Presidential appointees and confirmed by the Senate.  Two outcomes could come out of that.  One is that they could take the vote away from the presidents, which I think would be a disaster because then you’re not going to have good people going into the System.  We won’t have boards of directors that will be good.  We won’t have all of the benefits that we think we have from the current system.  The other alternative is that we then have presidents who are actually appointed by the President and then confirmed by the Senate.  I think, again, that hurts the private linkage. 125 of 145\f",
      "So I feel very strongly about all three of these issues, but I think that you’re going to come up with serious challenges in the future that could be very damaging to the System.  So I hope you think about this and still like me for being blunt, and also miss me because there will be a little less amusement.  Who else would have brought Monty Python into the FOMC?

Whether it’s sensible or not, the ECB has made a pretty strong distinction with us between their foreign exchange reserves and their dollars that they use in these operations.

They want, to some extent, to represent this as being a collaborative effort with the United States as opposed to something they are taking on their own behalf.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility is open ended in that it is limited only by the size of the tri-party repo system.  My point here is that, if foreign banks worry about capacity limits, even having a large program could in principle not be sufficient in extremis.  But if the program is open ended, the rollover risk problem goes away.  If I lend you more dollars today, I don’t have to worry about getting those dollars back because I always know that the facility is there.

[Laughter]  And 27 was just the right number.  I’d say a couple of thoughts were there.  One important point is that inflation in China has decelerated significantly.  In the spring they were looking at twelve-month inflation rates of around 8.3 percent.  The latest reading for August was 4.9 percent.  So it’s clearly on a decelerating trajectory.  That has been driven by a marked decline in food prices.  Earlier this year, food prices were moving up at over a 20 percent rate, and now it is about 10 percent.  So the the Olympics; and signs of slowing external demand have given them the scope they need to cut policy rates.

      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, it may surprise you that President Yellen and I agree, [laughter] at least with the recommendation, as I do with the majority.  I also agree firmly with President Hoenig.  David wanted to know a little more about Houston, so I will start out with that, and then I’ll quickly go to the policy matter. The storm devastated Galveston and Beaumont.  Their combined population is 650,000.  The population of the greater Houston area is 6.5 million.  The damage to Houston was moderate.  The overall effect on the Texas economy should be relatively mild.  We still expect employment growth this year of 1½ percent or so, plus or minus, even though the storm really hit hard an area that accounts for 26 percent of our employment and 30 percent of our output.  In terms of the national impact, I think it’s important to understand that the energy infrastructure took minor losses.  The short-term functioning of that infrastructure is hampered by power losses and water problems.  Gasoline prices have gone up because 3.9 million barrels a day, or roughly 22 percent of the U.S. refining capacity, has been shut down.  By the way, that affects the spot market—I think that’s some of the reason you’ve seen this weakness recently—and maybe the near-term futures market.  If you look at the gasoline price market, the gasoline price went up another 13 cents yesterday, but the near futures market is down 19 cents.  I think it reflects expectations that, once power is restored, the refineries will come back on line about a week later.  So we will likely have a temporary bump-up in inflation due to the gas prices.  But I think it is important to realize that this, unlike Katrina, didn’t shut down the Mississippi, and the effect on other commodity prices is likely not to be significant, with one exception.  If you look, you’ll see that prices of soybeans and soybean oil have spiked recently.  Clearly, the weather has an impact, but I think that’s more supply–demand imbalance—something that I’m watching carefully. 52 of 108\f",
      "The silver lining, if there is a silver lining to human tragedy, is probably twofold.  One is, if you notice, that lumber prices are actually up this year, which is kind of odd in terms of lumber trading.  Of course, lumber producers are probably pretty happy with the devastation in our state.  Second, Mexican laborers will be very happy if we let them into the country because the Hispanics build most of our buildings in the United States.  But I would say that the storm should not have any effect on nor should it alter our preferred policy direction, and I would like to talk about that very quickly. I have been affected in my thinking about economic growth and inflation by what I’m seeing overseas.  I’m globally oriented.  I do expect that we’re going to have less impetus from exports, which were significant in carrying our growth.  Our numbers show that, and your numbers, David, show that, and all of our conversations have revolved around that.  We were surprised on the upside by it.  Now I think weakening economic growth elsewhere is likely to subdue that effect.  We have also had an appreciation of the dollar.  Oil prices have declined.  I dove deep in my anecdotal explorations with the majors and also with all supply companies.  For whatever it’s worth, they are convinced that OPEC now has $100 rather than $70 as their benchmark.  Most of them expect prices to slide down to somewhere in the $80 range.  But over the longer term, whatever that term may be, we’re going to talk about $100-plus oil.  Then, of course, many commodity prices are off their peaks.  They have retraced significantly—some entirely. That said, in my anecdotal interchanges, I am still hearing about the likelihood, as I think President Pianalto mentioned, that people are seeking to preserve their margins.  They’ve been stung for many years, and I’ll just give you one case because I think it tells us something.  If you talk to the CEO of Wal-Mart USA, what they are pricing to be on their shelf six to eight months from now has an average price increase of 10 percent.  Now, of course, you might have this 53 of 108\f",

My biggest disappointment, incidentally, was that the one bakery that I’ve gone to for thirty years, Stein’s Bakery in Dallas, Texas, the best maker of not only bagels but also anything that has Crisco in it, [laughter] has just announced a price increase due to cost pressures.  But I do think we have a mitigation of inflation, and we also have a mitigation of the impetus to economic growth. As to the current financial predicament, I want to go back to a comment I made a long time ago.  This is not the first for me.  I like to tease President Stern about his maturity—I don’t go back to the Panic of 1890, but to Herstatt, 1974; New York City’s failure, 1975; 1987; and what happened in Japan.  Incidentally, you see the same pictures repeated in every newspaper.  It’s always the trader holding his head or looking up at the board.  Now it’s in color; it used to be black and white.  I think it comes from the same archive, and it is repeated throughout time.  [Laughter] All of that reminds me—forgive me for quoting Bob Dylan—but money doesn’t talk; it swears.  When you swear, you get emotional.  If you blaspheme, you lose control.  I think the main thing we must do in this policy decision today is not to lose control, to show a steady hand.

      "MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Since the last meeting, there have obviously been a number of flare-ups in the fires that have been burning in the financial markets—the GSEs and then certainly what’s come this past weekend and what’s likely to come over this week and into the future.  A number of people have mentioned things ranging from AIG to pressures on money very large thrift that will be facing a lot of challenges as the uncertainties in the markets continue.  I won’t repeat what Governor Kohn said about the continuing pressures on the bank balance sheets.  I think it is important to take into account that those pressures will be there going forward not only on U.S. institutions but also increasingly on international institutions.  No one has mentioned UBS yet, but that’s another institution about which there’s a lot of concern, and if you look at CDS quotes there, they are skyrocketing also.  Much as Governor Warsh said, I think that people are worried about what the next shoe to drop will be and whom we have to challenge.  Whom do we have to get more information about to make us feel comfortable?  If that suddenly becomes everyone, then of course the markets don’t function. I just want to focus quickly on consumption and consumer credit markets and then on inflation, and then I’ll conclude.  We have made some references to how consumers have acted in the past and whether they will continue to act this way.  In some sense the consumer has been on a 2001, significant declines in stock market wealth, September 11, corporate governance scandals, sustained job losses, and low real income growth.  Nonetheless, the consumer continued to consume.  But now the consumer seems to be flagging.  We have perhaps a very modest effect of the stimulus, which obviously can lead to negative payback for the rest of the year—so a drag going forward as well as drags from housing and stock market wealth, continuing job losses, rising 64 of 108\f",
      "unemployment, and pressures on income.  Although many of these shocks were similar to ones that happened earlier in the decade, it seems that consumers do not have the same resilience now that they did at one point.  It’s not surprising that, after having run this marathon, they’re going to be a bit tired. Part of it could also be the credit conditions that are putting much more pressure on them.  Just to give you an anecdotal report, but it’s from one of the largest providers of consumer credit in the economy.  After stabilization basically through our FOMC meeting in August, we’ve seen some significant deterioration in delinquencies and in the performance of those who get into delinquencies—they roll right to full chargeoff much more rapidly.  So we have seen not exactly a qualitative change but a significant deterioration.  Also, the ability to securitize credit cards has changed dramatically.  After our having opened the window and the markets having opened up in the second quarter, they basically haven’t been able to do anything in the third quarter, and that’s before this weekend.  Obviously that’s not going to be helping them. Of course, there are some offsetting factors that can help the consumer.  The very significant consumer credit in the United States.  The number of applications for mortgages, particularly for refis, has doubled over the last couple of weeks.  So people do respond to prices, and that can help to ease some of their income burdens.  Obviously, the reduction in energy prices and many food prices is helpful on that. But of course, what has been good news for U.S. consumers may not be good news for international consumers.  As a lot of people have mentioned, the rest of the world is seeing a very significant slowdown.  I think the elevated commodity prices had helped to mask a lot of the underlying fiscal and structural problems in these economies, actually much like rising housing 65 of 108\f",
      "prices in the United States had masked the problems in underwriting standards and what was going on in the mortgage market.  So I think there are going to be significant challenges in a lot of countries around the world.  The boost that we had earlier this year from the international sector is something we can’t rely on. On inflation, we’re heartened by some of the lower energy prices.  But I want to relate one anecdote.  In a meeting at the OECD, the CEO of one of the largest private oil producers in the world was asked what reference price he used because obviously he has to make tens of billions of dollars of decisions on investment and so they thought here’s someone who would really have a good notion of what the price of oil would be going forward.  Without hesitation the person responded, “$100, plus or minus $50.”  [Laughter]  That kind of uncertainty from someone who is really in the markets and making those kinds of decisions shows us that we have a reasonable degree of uncertainty in inflation pressures going forward.  That said, I think the Greenbook forecast is where I would be also, although we’re at uncomfortably elevated levels now.  There are a lot of reasons to believe that, although they may be even a bit more elevated in the coming quarter, there are likely forces to bring things back down.  This is particularly credible in the context of both survey-based and market-based expectations being quite contained, the market-based expectations being at the low of the year or even over the last couple of years. So this brings me to support alternative B for no change today.  On the statement, I do believe that some greater recognition of the stress would be valuable.  I think it would be valuable to have something in the first sentence of paragraph 2 that focuses on the strains—perhaps just a single sentence about the strains—and then we can put the other pieces on consumption and housing into the next sentence.  It is important in the final paragraph to leave our options open if we do see significant negative feedback effects so that we can make a move that wouldn’t be a shock to the 66 of 108\f",

      "MR. SHEETS.  In response to intensified global financial stresses, the central banks of four major emerging market economies—Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and Singapore—have recently expressed interest in temporary liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve.  For the reasons outlined in our background memo, which was circulated on Friday, the staff recommends that the Committee approve these requests.  We propose that the lines be sized at $30 billion for each of these four countries, similar to our existing lines with Canada, Sweden, and Australia.  We envision that these lines would expire on April 30, 2009, as is the case with our other swap lines.  We also recommend that these lines have several safeguards relative to our lines with central banks in the advanced economies.  Notably, even following initial FOMC approval, the proposed lines could not be drawn on without further authorization, and individual drawings would be limited to $5 billion.  We recommend that the FOMC delegate to its Foreign Currency Subcommittee the authority to approve these drawings.  The subcommittee would ensure that the dollars drawn would be used in a manner consistent with the purposes of the swap agreement.  The central banks in these countries would also agree to publicly announce the fact that they had drawn on their lines and the mechanisms that they had used to allocate the dollar liquidity.  These safeguards are designed to provide protections for Federal Reserve resources and to ensure that the swap lines are used in a manner consistent with our envisioned objectives.  These safeguards, however, are not intended to be so onerous as to discourage the use of the lines if the situation warrants.    We see the case for these swap lines as resting on three important observations.  First, each of these economies has significant economic and financial mass.  Mexico, Brazil, and Korea are all large economies with GDP of around $1 trillion, and Singapore is a major financial center.  Given the structural interconnectedness of the global economy and the financial fragilities that now prevail, a further intensification of stresses in one or more of these countries could trigger unwelcome spillovers for both the U.S. economy and the international economy more generally.  Our interdependencies with Mexico are particularly pronounced.  Second, these economies have generally pursued prudent policies in recent years, resulting in low inflation and roughly balanced current account and fiscal positions or, in the case of Singapore, sizable surpluses.  Accordingly, the stresses that these countries are feeling seem largely to reflect financial contagion effects from the advanced economies, including sharp reductions in risk appetite, rapid deleveraging by global investors, and a drying up of liquidity in dollar funding markets.  Third, there is good reason to believe that swap lines with the Federal Reserve would be helpful in defusing the economic and financial pressures that they now face.  These lines would promote financial stability by helping to ensure that financial institutions and corporations in these countries have access to dollar liquidity.  Dollar funding pressures in Brazil and Korea appear to have intensified significantly.  Such pressures remain less acute in Mexico and Singapore, but the authorities there view these lines as valuable protection should such pressures intensify, particularly over year-end.  In 10 of 206\f",
      "addition, the authorities in these countries have expressed the view that these lines could provide a significant boost to confidence, although such outcomes are admittedly hard to predict.    I turn now to two questions that have been the focus of energetic deliberations among the staff as we have formulated these proposals.  First, is there some better approach that we could recommend?  Second, what are the risks associated with initiating swap facilities with these emerging market economies, or EMEs?  As for the first question, we could ask these countries to rely on their sizable stocks of foreign exchange reserves.  Across many contingencies, we believe that these countries do have sufficient resources to address financial pressures on their own.  Consistent with this observation, they don’t have any immediate plans to draw on their swap lines.  In this sense, the lines serve as a backstop.  However, in the event of intensified stresses, we believe that it would be desirable for these countries to able to meet the dollar funding needs of their institutions by drawing on the swaps rather than by going into the Treasury or agency markets to liquefy their foreign exchange reserves.  Alternatively, we could ask these countries to go to the IMF.  Tomorrow, the Fund is likely to approve a large, rapidly disbursing facility that might be appropriate.  That said, we see the IMF’s efforts in this area as broadly complementary to those of the Federal Reserve.  Meeting the potential liquidity needs of these large countries would strain the available resources of the Fund.  Conversely, the Fund is much better placed than we are to judge the liquidity needs of smaller, less systemically important countries.  As an additional consideration, these top-tier EMEs that we are recommending for swap lines are very reluctant to return to the IMF.  Given the strength of their policies, they no longer view themselves as clients of the Fund and would prefer to go it alone rather than seek IMF financial support.  We note that there are indeed risks associated with our recommendation.  One obvious concern is that the swaps might not be repaid.  However, given the large reserve holdings of these countries, their prudent policies, the weight they place on good relations with us, and the safeguards built into the swap agreements, we judge the risk to Federal Reserve resources to be very low.  More notable is the risk that approving these lines might cause us to be flooded with requests from many additional EMEs.  Nevertheless, in proposing lines with these four countries, we feel that we have set the bar quite high.  Their importance to the global economy and the quality of their policies set a standard that few, if any, other EMEs can match.  In addition, the potential IMF liquidity swap facility might be helpful to us in limiting the risk of a slippery slope, as additional countries that request lines with us could be asked to go to the IMF.  Similarly, European EMEs seeking swap lines could be encouraged to approach the ECB.   In assessing these issues, the staff has conferred with senior officials at the U.S. Treasury and the State Department.  In both instances, these agencies emphasized the global economic significance of Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore.  However, they also cautioned that expanding the swap lines beyond this group could leave us 11 of 206\f",
      "increasingly vulnerable to a “pile on” effect, which might manifest itself either in a large number of additional swap line requests or in political pressure.  Given these considerations, the staff would benefit from some signal from the FOMC regarding its willingness to consider swap lines with other emerging market economies.  We see two broad options in this regard.  First, the FOMC could indicate that it is not inclined to establish swap lines with other EMEs.  Inquiries from additional countries could be forwarded to the IMF.  Alternatively, the FOMC could emphasize that the bar for any additional EME facilities is high and that swap lines would be extended only if the case is seen as being comparable to that of the four countries that are being voted on today.  Under this second approach, the FOMC might consider granting the Foreign Currency Subcommittee the authority to establish swap lines with the central banks of other large and systemically important EMEs.  Bill Bassett will now continue our presentation.   \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I have never stood in their shoes, so I’m not sure I fully understand it.  You are right that the world is a little short of the risk-free asset now, and so a greater supply would be terrific in some sense.  But they have a general view, which I think our people share, that to meet the kind of lumpy, unpredictable, potentially large needs for lender-of-last-resort purposes you may face in our currency, you have to manage reserves in a way that you can meet those needs without selling Treasuries or agencies.  It would not be so terrific for the world.  I have never stood on the other side, but that’s my basic sense.  Another way to think about this is that the privilege of being the reserve currency of the world comes with some burdens.  Not that we have an obligation in this sense, but we have an interest in helping these guys mitigate the problems they face in dealing with currency mismatches in their financial systems.  We have an interest in helping them meet that in some sense.  It’s not our obligation.  We have the same basic interest that led us to be responsive to the European need in some cases.  These guys are different in that they actually have managed the countries’ balance sheets better because they at least have a huge amount of their assets in dollars.  That should make us in some ways as comfortable as—maybe more comfortable than—doing it with the Europeans because they ran a banking system that was allowed to get very, very big relative to GDP with huge currency mismatches and with no plans to meet the liquidity needs of their banks in dollars in the event that we face a storm like this. \n",

      "MR. SHEETS.  I would hope that initiating these swaps would reduce the probability of bad outcomes in the emerging market economies.  Certainly, if Brazil, Mexico, and Korea are up against the ropes and experiencing significant financial stresses, my sense is that it would be an environment in which many other EMEs would be experiencing negative spillovers.  So to the extent that we can backstop these major linchpins in the emerging market world, I see that as having very positive effects for others.  That would be one point.  Second, the decision as to how to handle Chile, if Chile comes to us for a swap line, I think is very much a policy decision for the Committee to determine.  As I said in the remarks, we as staff members would very much appreciate some sort of signal from you as to whether you want to say four and that’s all we’re willing to do, and everyone else—Chile, India, and South Africa—goes to the Fund?  Or is the Committee open to having potentially a few other large, important emerging market economies have swap lines with the Federal Reserve?  I see that as being a policy decision. \n",

      "MR. SHEETS.  As outlined in the memo and then also my remarks, the first is that we are looking for economies that are large and systemically important.  The second is that we are looking for economies in which their policies have been strong and it appears that they are largely being influenced by contagion.  The third piece is countries for which we believe that the swap line might actually make a difference.   Now, let me just give you a concrete case of the third criterion because that’s a little more abstract than the first two.  Iceland came to us and requested a swap line of approximately $1 billion to $2 billion, which would have been 5 to 10 percent of Iceland’s GDP—so it was fairly large relative to the size of the country.  But the liabilities of the banking system were on the order of $170 billion, and the underlying problem was really that there was a loss of confidence in its banks.  We came to the conclusion that a $1 billion to $2 billion swap line was very little ammunition to use against a potential loss in confidence in this $170 billion financial system.  For that reason, we as the staff recommended against a swap line for Iceland. Those are the three conditions that we’d emphasize.  Sort of subsidiary to that is that I think it is very appropriate for all the European EMEs to report to the ECB for their liquidity needs.  That would further constrain the list of countries that we’d look at.  As we work down the list of countries, I think it gets easier to say “no” in that fewer and fewer of the countries can make a case that they are large and systemically important.  With the risk of creating stigma, some countries are big, and some aren’t, and that’s pretty darn objective.  Now, you can debate about, well, what’s big and what isn’t and where you draw the line, but it just so happens that these three major economies that we’re putting forward all have GDP of around $1 trillion.  That seems like a reasonable line to draw.  Again, there’s an element of arbitrariness here, but any line you draw will have an element of arbitrariness to it. 33 of 206\n",

It would not surprise me at all if, when we are finished with this process—I hope over the next six weeks as we go through a couple more reserve maintenance period rounds—that that margin might be zero and we might see the federal funds rate trading right on top of the interest rate on reserves.  But we are going to have to see.  I think our presumption at the current time would be to recommend to the Board next round to narrow that spread further—it is 35 basis points today.  Another thing that we don’t know is how much learning is going to go on by banks.  So the selling of fed funds below the interest rate on reserves is not just the GSEs; it is also banks, and so it’s a little hard to understand exactly why they’re doing that unless the leverage ratio is what’s driving that behavior.  Maybe they are just not very well informed or they haven’t gotten their first check for the interest rate compensation, so I think it’s a little too soon to be certain about how they’re going to behave going forward.

In my thinking, a 25 basis point cut today is part of a total 75 basis point action, including the October 8 move.  I believe the deterioration we have seen in September and October and the resulting downward revision of the outlook merit a cumulative response of this magnitude.  That said, I am sympathetic to the view that we would be well advised to keep some powder dry to respond to shocks or developments ahead.  I anticipate that, because a number of the dynamics in the markets have not really played out, we will have more shocks and they could come from further financial institution failures, corporate failures, a sovereign debt crisis, and market disarray; and in other markets, such as the municipal market, there is always a chance of a geopolitical event.  In all likelihood these things come in combination or in rapid fire.  So, as I said, I am sympathetic to the “powder dry” view, but I see the powder dry objective as being in conflict with responding to the recent deterioration.

We’re sort of running that experiment right now.  The market consensus is that the Fed is going to reduce the target 50 basis points at this meeting.

My guess is that, if our baseline forecast evolves in the way we are expecting here, you are still going to be worried about the downside risk to inflation even if, in fact, we were in the process of bottoming out because there will still be a very substantial output gap.  On the commodity price side, things are fairly stable, and at least in our forecast, inflation expectations are probably drifting down some.  On the other hand, there are upside risks to that inflation forecast as well.  I do actually think that our baseline forecast, on the assumptions that we have had to make in constructing it, is reasonably well balanced because another possibility is, in contrast to the gradual downtrend that we’re expecting in inflation expectations, that inflation expectations will be stickier, you will be able to convey a greater sense that you wouldn’t want inflation over the longer haul moving down below 1 percent, we won’t get as much disinflation into inflation expectations or into labor costs, and you’ll get greater stability there than we’re expecting.  So to my mind, looking ahead, monitoring how those inflation expectations evolve in the context of an economy where things are weakening will be very important. \n",

If I can also just put this in a little more context—by the end of 2010, the gap on the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control is about 1 percentage point.  So if you use a simple rule of thumb from an Okun’s law type of model, that would be a couple of percentage points on the level of GDP.  GDP would have to grow a couple of percentage points faster over 2009 and 2010 to close that 1 percentage point gap in the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control. \n",

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District’s economy, like the others, has systematically worsened.  Layoffs are increasing.  Our retail sales are down.  The housing energy is showing a pretty good slowdown with these falloffs in prices, and rigs are being stacked; the agricultural sector is also feeling the pressure as commodity prices fall.  So it is uniformly poor.  As far as the national economy and outlook go, I have no major differences with the outlook that has been presented by others.  I would tell you that we have done different projections ourselves.  I think a lot depends on what will be developed on the fiscal side as we move from here, and I am kind of waiting to see about that. I do have one other comment and perhaps request as we think about this, and it follows on yesterday’s conversation.  It strikes me, as I look broadly and see what’s happening in our own region, that the intermediation process is broken as it goes through the banking industry and then more broadly than that.  The deleveraging process that is under way is actually accelerating—it is worsening and complicating our ability to fix the intermediation process.  As a result, we as the central bank are going around that process as we try to get credit working, and I understand that.  But it does have consequences—some good for those particular markets where we’re bringing intermediation forward but also perhaps some not so good as other sectors are left behind in that.  My point is that we really do have to focus, in working on the fiscal side with the Treasury or whomever, on fixing the broken intermediation process, and that is the banking industry.  I know we are working with the TARP.  It needs some additional work.  But out of that comes my request.  We spent a fair amount of time yesterday talking about the Japanese experience.  I wonder if we wouldn’t benefit if we looked at the Nordic experience of the early ’90s—how you go in, take a look at that, and how you conduct policy around that—and have a discussion among ourselves 138 of 284\f",

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the others who have spoken before me, I think this situation is very serious.  We need to do all we can, and I think we need to recognize the reality of where we are.  So either alternative A or alternative B does that to a significant extent.  I guess I have a slight preference for alternative A as a better recognition that we are not really controlling the federal funds rate in here.  We have these other balance sheet things going on, and to me alternative B has a little of the flavor of drawing your target around the hole we have already made in the barn door, or whatever, and pretending that you have some control that you don’t really have.  So I think A is better.  President Bullard made a very good point that A tends to refocus attention on these alternative policies that we all agree will be the focus of our attention going forward.  But I could live with either A or B. In terms of some of the issues you raised—so going down alternative A—in paragraph 2, the bracketed language, here I agree with President Lacker.  I think my slight preference would be to wait until January to do this.  Whether or not we have an explicit inflation target as we come out of the January meeting, we can debate in January.  We will, I hope, have at least these long-run projections, and this bracketed language can be explained in terms of those long-run projections.  Right now, it kind of sits out there.  We haven’t yet explained what we think the rates are that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.  By the end of the January meeting, we can do that.  So I think I would wait for that. I think the conditional language in the third paragraph is helpful, and I would favor keeping it in.  It is appropriately conditioned on weak economic conditions.  If other people wanted to add “the disinflationary forces,” which I think come primarily from the weak economic conditions, that would be okay with me, too.  But I am fine with this. 181 of 284\f",
      "In the first sentence of paragraph 4—this is a small point—I would take out the “to continue”:  “The focus of policy going forward will be to support the functioning . . ..”  When I first read the “to continue,” it sounded as though we are just going to continue what we are doing now.  So I would take that out, but that is a small point.  On the discussion about whether we should put the size in, I am a little worried about putting it in because the balance sheet has grown so rapidly.  If it came down because year-end pressures abated and because the swaps with all of those foreign central banks might tend to come down after the end of the year, I don’t think that the Committee would necessarily want Bill to be replacing every dollar of Eurodollar swaps that came down with something else.  I think we are talking about a long-run trend in the base, and we need to be careful about not trying to leave the impression that in every intermeeting period we would expect the base to increase, especially when we don’t control that size.  So I would be a little cautious about that.  Certainly, if we did include “increase the size of the balance sheet,” I also would say something about the composition.  In my view, it is actually the composition more than the size that is going to influence relative asset prices, even though I do recognize that over very long periods, if we keep the base from declining, it would be hard to have prices decline.  But I am not sure that is really an effective way to deal with expectations in the short or intermediate run. I would include the purchases of longer-term Treasury securities.  Among other things, I think we ought to do it sometime in the next few months.  The fact that you have already talked about it, if we omit it—I guess I disagree with President Evans here—I don’t think that will be low cost.  We have a series of things we are doing, and that is not part of it.  I think there could be an adverse market reaction.  Going back to the base for a second, I agree that we need to do a better job of explaining, as I said yesterday, what this new framework is, how the increase in 182 of 284\f",
      "reserves and the base fits into it—if we can come to some conclusion on that—and why under these circumstances a very large increase in the base isn’t inflationary and how that comes about.  We need to do a much better job of explaining these kinds of things.  But, again, I would be hesitant to put an explicit target in terms of the level of reserves or the base in there because I don’t really understand the channels through which they influence prices or activity in the short and intermediate terms. Finally, on bank profits and the effects there, ordinarily I wouldn’t worry about bank profits.  It is just a transfer between the owners of banks and households and businesses, and quite frankly, transferring some income to households and businesses seems like a pretty good idea most of the time in these circumstances.  I agree that it is more ambiguous than usual, given the worries about the financial sector.  Still, we are doing a lot for the banks.  We are giving them capital.  We are guaranteeing their liabilities—we, the government, that is.  This will reduce the rates at which they borrow from the discount window and from each other, so they are getting something there.  I think banks are going to need to figure out how to operate at these really low interest rates, so I wouldn’t let my concern about bank profits stop me from doing either alternative A or alternative B.

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  These are, indeed, troubling times, and I think in troubling times it’s even more important that we be as transparent and clear as possible.  I think it’s time that we publicly convey that we have entered a new monetary policy regime.  To do otherwise perpetuates the view that we are no longer in control of monetary policy rather than that we have opted to implement policy through a different means, particularly our balance sheet. There’s ample room for judgment here and disagreement, but, Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I’m deeply troubled by elements of the steps that we are taking today.  In effect, I interpret our proposed actions as substituting credit-allocation policies for monetary policies.  Both the expansion of our balance sheet and the fed funds rate are now determined or will be now determined by decisions about which markets or firms are deemed worthy of our intervention and support and some assessment of how much money we want to throw at them.  I think we all agree that we are looking for the best policies.  I think that it’s also true that best policies are based on clearly articulated goals and objectives and in credible and systematic actions to achieve those goals and objectives, and they can also be credibly communicated to the public.  I feel that our approach to credit policy comes up lacking in each of these dimensions.  Our goal may be to prevent systemic risk, but we haven’t clearly defined what that is or the criteria that we’re using to decide whom to lend to and when to lend to them.  It’s very important for both clarity and transparency that we rectify this deficiency, or we may continue to create moral hazard and to see market after market after market seek our help. The message from the literature we discussed yesterday is that near the zero bound our credibility and our commitment to generate inflation and prevent expectations of deflation to develop are paramount.  My reading of the proposed language is that it does little to signal that commitment.  Indeed, it seems to suggest that our primary objectives are and will continue to be 191 of 284\f",
      "credit interventions.  Confusing our monetary policy objectives with our credit policies is not the kind of message that I’m comfortable with.  I think we need to be careful not to convey to the do that. President Lacker articulated the importance in the current environment of keeping inflation expectations well anchored, and measures of the base—or if you would rather, look at the asset side of the balance sheet, either way they’re both measuring the balance sheet—are a means of anchoring those expectations.  I don’t think the language of the directive or the statement is clear enough in addressing either the effectiveness of monetary policy or the credible commitment to avoid deflation or even to maintain inflation near our target, which is clearly not deflation.  I’m not quite as fearful of deflation as President Bullard or some others, but I think we need to be mindful and reinforce our commitment to low but stable inflation. On the governance side, I continue to believe that the FOMC is the appropriate body for making monetary policy decisions and that replacing monetary policy with credit policies that are unconstrained by this Committee is to violate both good governance and the spirit of the operating understanding of the FOMC.  Yesterday and in my memo to the Committee earlier this week, I argued that the directive and the statement should clearly state that we are in a new regime and should articulate how that new regime will operate going forward.  My interpretation is that the proposed language, particularly alternative A, does help indicate that we are moving to a new regime.  That’s important, and therefore, I lean in that direction.  But that language fails to articulate how that new regime will operate, except to say that the Board of Governors will continue credit implicit message is—and I think the market will clearly interpret it this way—that the FOMC has 192 of 284\f",
      "ceded monetary policy decisions to the Board of Governors, and I think that will be damaging.  Such a step, in my view, is not good policy, nor is it good governance, and it may have political ramifications as well.  Once the Committee sets the precedent that the Board of Governors can assume sole responsibility for monetary policy, we run the risk of losing the strength and the diversity of views that the System has always brought. My sense is that this Committee’s setting some kind of cap on the size of the balance sheet was an effort to clarify the role of monetary policy in contrast to credit policy.  I think the reaction I heard yesterday around the table was a litany of reasons why setting base growth targets is not appropriate.  While that might be an interesting debate to have, that was not the point I was proposing.  I was requesting that we have a debt ceiling, if you will, and that the FOMC would review and adjust that debt ceiling as it deemed appropriate—not targets for balance sheets per se.  Such a debt ceiling would not prevent the Board of Governors from managing the asset side of the balance sheet via 13(3) lending.  Only when unsterilized lending exceeded the debt ceiling might formal approval be required from the FOMC.  Mr. Chairman, my discomfort is not a matter simply of good governance.  It is more fundamentally about the lack of clarity, discipline, and transparency that the strategy is offering, and I have deep concerns. I’d like to offer a couple of suggestions for the Committee to consider about language, and I’m working off alternative A, which I think is probably the working hypothesis here.  So to answer your questions, Mr. Chairman, I have been and continue to be in favor of an explicit inflation target.  Most of you are aware of that.  I am sympathetic to the view, as I think President Lacker said, that slipping it in in the dead of night is probably not the right way to go about it.  I would add that I do not like the bracketed phrase regarding the Committee’s seeing some risk of inflation coming in too low.  As President Lacker suggested, it might cause fear in the marketplace.  But I do think we 193 of 284\f",
      "could change the second bracketed statement, which was struck out:  “In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek . . . a rate of inflation . . . of about 2 percent.”  I think we could change that and heighten the importance of inflation to us and our dual mandate by saying something to the effect of “in support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek a low and stable inflation rate over the intermediate term.”  That would be short of specifying an inflation target but would reinforce the notion that we are still committed to achieving a low but stable inflation rate. My biggest problem is with paragraph 4, which I think could be simplified greatly.  I would like to emphasize that monetary policy remains in the purview of the FOMC and that we have entered a new regime.  So I would propose, just for the sake of getting it on the table, that paragraph 4 be simplified to say that “the focus of the FOMC’s monetary policy going forward will be to continue to support the dual mandate and the functioning of a financial market to stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that entail the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.”  Then I would say, “Today the FOMC affirms the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet up to $3 trillion and will periodically review and adjust that in the pursuit of our dual mandate.”  Repeating the litany of credit-market interventions that we have engaged in seems just repeating what we’ve already done.  I’m not sure that serves much purpose in the context of monetary policy making at this point.  I’m not opposed to buying GSEs.  I’m not opposed to buying longer-term Treasuries.  I think we need to modify Brian Madigan’s statement about the conditions under which we should purchase GSEs so that we are being internally consistent, but I don’t have any objection to it. So I think we could be clearer.  We could be less confusing in our policies by emphasizing again our commitment to keep inflation stable and at a positive level and clearly indicating that quantities do matter and that this Committee is responsible for those quantities and will interact with 194 of 284\f",

      "MS. CUMMING.  Yes, thank you.  Like others, I see the circumstances as requiring the most action we can take.  Therefore, I would favor alternative A somewhat over alternative B, but I could live with either.  I think that alternative A has the advantage, which President Bullard described and others have referred to, that it does signal a significant change in what we’re doing and draws attention to it.  If anything, it probably provokes more dialogue with us as a central bank, which I think at this point is a good thing. Turning to the next paragraph, I’m a bit concerned that inflation is, in fact, moderating very quickly.  This morning’s number for the total CPI is 1.1 percent.  That would lead me to ask whether we are expecting inflation to moderate or are, in fact, seeing inflation moderating.  This point is similar to President Stern’s.  That would also lead me to leave in the bracketed point about the future and the concern there because I think it’s better if we put it on the table than have people say, “Don’t they see that as a problem?”  To that end, I also want to endorse the kind of broad strategy statement that President Lockhart put forward.  I actually came into the meeting with a very similar sentence from my staff, really talking about what our goal is.  I think it does help to set the stage for what follows here, and this was a focus on improving conditions in financial markets or financial intermediation and ensuring a recovery in output and maintaining low inflation. \n",

      "MS. CUMMING.  Then continuing with this, I would comment on the next paragraph.  I’m very sympathetic to the idea that President Lacker was putting forward—that we somehow need to talk about our expectations about the size of the balance sheet.  I was going to offer one suggestion:  Perhaps for the “entail the use of” phrase in the first sentence of paragraph 4 we could substitute “sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at very high levels”—something that would indicate that we expect the balance sheet to remain really large but doesn’t talk about whether we’re increasing it from today.  Just a thought.  I would leave in the sentence on the longer-term Treasuries in large part because we have already talked about it publicly and the language here gives us the opportunity to evaluate and does not necessarily commit us to those purchases in the future.  In any case, we would need to explain whether or not we’re going to purchase longer-term Treasuries, having raised it already. On the directive, I would say that I am comfortable with the directives as written.  There might be room, if we found the right language for the size of the balance sheet, for inserting that sentence in here, for example, whatever we take from the first sentence of paragraph 4.  I also think that, as part of this monitoring that the System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will provide for the Committee, there really is the opportunity to develop much better disclosure of what the Committee is doing, what our balance sheet looks like, and what actions we’re taking—some kind of ongoing monitoring that could be shared with the public that I think would also be very helpful in explaining what the Federal Reserve is actually pursuing in the near term and what it is doing with the balance sheet. I was really impressed by something that President Lacker said yesterday, which is that—and I paraphrase—we are in uncharted waters but we are groping our way forward.  I think that it is a great metaphor for where, in fact, we are.  Some of these questions—such as what specific 198 of 284\f",

And until 18 months ago you could have gotten the financing from Deutsche Bank, the Swiss banks, or any of our fine U.S. banks; but it doesn’t appear at the moment that any of them are terribly interested in lending on a secured basis even to the strongest of hedge funds.  They’re simply hiding somewhere. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, I guess there are at least a couple of theories you could have.  One of them has to do with capital.  If you think that certain types of intermediaries have specialized knowledge and their ability to lend depends on their capital, then there are informational asymmetries in which clearly exogenous destruction of part of that capital is going to affect equilibrium outcomes in the market.  That’s one possibility.  The other class of models has to do with liquidity, where you have thick or thin markets depending on “I trade if you trade” and so on and you have markets in which nobody is trading and so no one wants to be the first to enter.  By becoming a marketmaker, you can perhaps generate more activity.   I think there are some interesting perspectives out there. \n",

As long as the markets act as if we or someone else is going to step in and rescue them from any more lending arrangements they happen to be facing, the incentives for the intermediary system to repair itself or to gradually adjust are going to be limited.

      "MS. MOSSER.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Spence and I will be referring to the financial conditions and facilities handout in front of you.  Stress in financial markets has eased somewhat in recent weeks, but very unevenly.  Markets directly supported by the Federal Reserve or government actions have seen declines in spreads, improved liquidity, and modest increases in trading and lending activity.  But markets beyond the reach of Fed and government programs remain very strained.  Moreover, the economic and financial downturn is very rapidly depleting banks’ capital cushions.  Let me start with markets in which the Fed has intervened.  Interbank lending spreads, shown in exhibit 1, have continued to narrow.  The sharpest declines in LIBOR–OIS spreads actually occurred before year-end, and at present, one-week and one-month spreads are below their early September levels.  The declines in spreads occurred at the same time that private lending among banks increased modestly— particularly at the one-week and one-month tenors.  But almost no one is willing to take the risk of lending on an unsecured basis to a bank for more than a month.  As a result, LIBOR spreads three months and beyond remain elevated.  As Spence will discuss in more detail, declining spreads and increased private-sector lending have been reflected in reduced demand for term liquidity at our facilities.  Similarly, in commercial paper markets, activity is up, and spreads are down.  Rates on all types of A1-rated paper have declined—you can see this in the second exhibit—since the announcements of the various Fed facilities for commercial paper and money market funds.  After year-end, even A2/P2 commercial paper spreads, which are not eligible for the CPFF, fell sharply.  In exhibit 3, consumer mortgage rates, as well as mortgage and agency spreads have declined notably since the announcement of the Fed purchase programs in during the first week of the purchase program in early January.  Retail conforming mortgage rates have increased somewhat from very low levels in early January, moving up with long-term Treasury yields, but they remain well below the levels that prevailed before the Fed’s purchase program was announced.  Spence will be talking in more detail about the MBS purchase program in a few minutes.   The FDIC guarantee of financial debt has had an indirect effect on the corporate bond market.  Corporate bond spreads, pictured in exhibit 4, widened throughout the fall, but since December these spreads—which do not include FDIC guaranteed debt—have declined.  At the same time, the nonguaranteed portion of new issuance, seen in exhibit 5, has actually increased; in just the first two weeks of January, it accounted for more than half of new issuance.  Apparently, guaranteed debt is not attractive to traditional corporate bond investors, so they have shifted into obligations of nonfinancial issuers.  This has effectively increased demand for a small pool of corporate bond issuers, causing spreads to decline.                                                    1 The materials used by Ms. Mosser and Mr. Hilton are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).   14 of 267\f",
      " In contrast, markets without Fed or government backstop—such as consumer­asset-backed securities, commercial-mortgage-backed securities, and leveraged loans—have shown little or no improvement.  Consumer ABS spreads (exhibit 6) have narrowed a bit since the passing of year-end but remain very elevated despite expectations for the beginning of the TALF program in late February or early March.  Activity is at a standstill, and according to both the packagers and the buyers of securitized products, it is likely to remain so until the TALF is up and running and  CMBS and leveraged-loan prices, shown in the next exhibit, seemed to stabilize late last year but recently have fallen even further as the macroeconomic outlook has continued to worsen more sharply than expected.  The outlook for nonagency mortgage securities continues to deteriorate.  Recently the rating agencies projected even larger losses, which will cause formerly AAA super senior tranches to be downgraded to default-level ratings.  All of this is, of course, more bad news for holders of these securities—including banks, insurers, and the GSEs—which are likely to face larger write-downs on mark-to-market assets and significantly larger impairment charges.  Recent headlines about capital impairments at several of the Federal Home Loan Banks reflect these ongoing write-downs.   Despite the modest improvements in some markets, one should not underestimate how remarkably fragile financial markets are right now.  The process of deleveraging, asset sales, and overall reduction in the risk profile of large financial institutions continues unabated—although in a somewhat more orderly way than a couple of months ago.  Lack of liquidity is one symptom of this fragility.  Although liquidity has improved since the beginning of the year, for most markets this improvement can be characterized as moving from “nonexistent” to “very poor.”  Even core benchmark liquidity.  Volumes are at multiyear lows.  Bid-asked spreads in euro–dollar foreign exchange trading (exhibit 8) have more than doubled.  In benchmark Treasury shown in exhibit 9—is 0.1 of normal.  Volatility has remained correspondingly high across nearly all markets, even with the improved conditions in the last few weeks.  High volatility and poor liquidity can be self-reinforcing.  They raise the cost of making and underwriting markets, which leads to less trading, higher spreads, less credit formation, and in general a lot less risk-taking.  The lack of liquidity across markets has led to some obvious unexploited profit opportunities.  Exhibits 10 and 11 give a couple of examples.  Exhibit 10 shows the average error between the yield on 10-year Treasury securities and the predicted yield for those securities based on the Board’s model.  In normal market conditions, a host of market participants—trading desks, institutional investors, and hedge funds—trade constantly each day to exploit such large gaps and arbitrage them away.  At present, a combination of balance sheet constraints and high volatility has caused a pullback in this activity, which, again, is self-reinforcing.  Exhibit 11 has a second example of an unexploited profit opportunity—namely, the spread between yields on corporate 15 of 267\f",
      "credit default swaps (CDS) and corporate bonds.  Even in normal market conditions, the corporate CDS market is the more liquid (because it requires less balance sheet and is a more standardized product), but the difference amounts to a few basis points.  Currently the spread between CDS and corporate bonds is more than 200 basis points for “liquid” investment-grade bonds and nearly 450 basis points for high yield.   Large losses and associated balance sheet constraints of banks and dealers are major reasons for the drying up of liquidity across markets.  But also important is the lack of arbitrageurs—most notably hedge funds.  Hedge fund losses in the last few months have been enormous.  As exhibit 12 shows, 2008 was the worst year on record for the hedge fund industry, with losses of 20 to 40 percent for the group.  Almost every type of hedge fund had double-digit losses (except short equity, and they were shut out of the market for some time).  Losses were concentrated in the second half of the year, with about two-thirds of them in the last quarter.  The poor performance provoked record redemptions, estimated to be at least $150 billion and as much as $400 billion.  Of course, redemptions would have been much larger if many—particularly large—hedge funds had not shut their gates.  In response, hedge funds have deleveraged very quickly, adding more downward pressure to asset prices and further undermining liquidity.  In short, the capacity of the financial system to absorb and mitigate shocks is small—as small as it has been during this crisis.   At present, there are two closely linked risks to the fragile equilibrium in markets.  One, of course, is the continued rapid deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, both in the United States and globally.  The second is the truly precarious financial condition of many of the largest financial institutions, particularly the global banks.  Fourth-quarter bank earnings, which we are in the midst of receiving, were expected to be very bad, and in fact have been even worse for the major U.S. banks, as exhibit 13 shows.  Earnings expectations for large European banks are even worse than for U.S. banks.  If they disappoint to the same degree, the Q4 losses just for the banks in the table could easily be above $70 billion.  Adding in the hedge fund losses and the large expected losses at the GSEs and insurance companies, Q4 losses in the hundreds of billions seem likely.   The outlook for banks is hugely uncertain.  Simply put, investors are worried about the size of the “hole” in banks’ balance sheets—that is, the size of the additional asset write-downs and reserving that will be necessary.  If the hole is large, as anticipated, or worse, enormous, how will banks be able to fill it?  As exhibit 14 shows, banks’ regulatory capital ratios look fairly robust, but for large banks, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets—a metric that investors and rating agencies follow closely—looks much more precarious.  Most important, losses come first out of common equity.  Replacing those losses at current share prices implies potentially massive dilution for current shareholders.  As a result, bank equity prices remain under severe pressure—as can be seen in exhibits 15, 16, and 17.  To scale just how far bank equity prices have fallen, the market cap of all U.S. banks (including investment banks) is now about the same as the market cap of the soft drink industry. 16 of 267\f",
      " The downward pressure on U.S. and European bank stocks is reinforced by uncertainty about the form and size of government intervention, particularly for the weakest players, which are viewed as closer to insolvency or government assistance.  Even if some investors view banks as having significant long-term value, the possibility of government dilution or even nationalization discourages capital injections from the private sector.  In contrast, government support of banks has capped their credit spreads, which you can see in exhibits 18, 19, and 20.  Although credit tiering is evident in CDS spreads, the level of bank CDS for both U.S. and foreign banks has remained in the high end of the investment-grade range.  Equity holders may expect to be wiped out, but debt holders clearly view the probability of  losses as fairly low.   of the economy and the financial system have had a significant effect on sovereign credit default swap spreads.  The CDS spreads in exhibit 21 have risen because the expected fiscal cost has soared and because of uncertainty about the ultimate size of the bill—which will depend critically on global economic growth and on the magnitude of government assistance to financial institutions.  Not surprisingly, CDS spreads for small countries with relatively large financial services sector—such as the United Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland—have increased proportionally the most.  In recent weeks, movements in sovereign CDS spreads have mirrored movements in the countries’ bank CDS spreads.  Accompanying the increase in sovereign CDS spreads has been a pronounced steepening of yield curves in the major economies.  Exhibit 22 shows that in recent weeks Treasury yields in the United States are up at all maturities, but the increases in longer-term yields are particularly large—the 30-year is up about 40 basis points in the last week and a half or so.  Part of this increase is likely due to short-run supply increases.  In the next few weeks, $150 billion of new Treasury coupon securities will be auctioned, and this week alone, we are auctioning $200 billion of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.  Given illiquid market conditions, we shouldn’t be surprised to see a rise in yields that is somewhat exaggerated.  Nonetheless, with large and sustained fiscal deficits on the horizon, somewhat higher borrowing rates are not too surprising.  Finally, a few words about monetary policy expectations.  The results of the Desk’s latest dealer survey are shown in exhibit 23.  Neither the dealers nor the futures markets expect any change in the target fed funds range in the near term.  Dealer economists expect the current fed funds target range to be maintained well into 2010, reflecting widespread views that the combination of a deep recession and continued financial crisis will require easy monetary conditions for some time to  come.  Spence will now discuss the balance sheet and the use of facilities.   \n",

      "MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you.  The staff is recommending that the Board and the FOMC act to extend the various liquidity facilities that are scheduled to expire on temporary reciprocal foreign-currency arrangements are all currently scheduled to expire at the end of April.  As Trish noted, conditions in some financial markets have improved somewhat in recent months, but those improvements have been limited.  With the macroeconomic situation and the condition of financial institutions both deteriorating significantly, the recent improvements would seem to be attributable not to any strengthening of the fundamentals but rather to the range of actions taken by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the FDIC, the Congress, and foreign central banks and governments to stabilize the financial system as well as to the passage of year-end.  As Spence has noted, even though the usage of some facilities has declined, amounts outstanding under some programs, such as the CPFF, remain substantial.  Moreover, the level of usage is by no means an adequate metric for assessing the contributions of these programs to stabilizing markets.  In many cases, market participants continue to look to the facilities as important backstops for their funding.  In these circumstances, it would seem premature to consider terminating any of the existing liquidity facilities at this time.    Although the facilities do not expire for three months, the staff believes that the Board and the FOMC should act now to extend them.  Absent an action to extend the programs, market participants and analysts are likely to speculate increasingly about the Federal Reserve’s intentions for the facilities, which probably would add unhelpfully to market jitters.  Also, lenders may increasingly become concerned that borrowers will not have access to backup funding facilities to repay currently extended loans when those credits mature in a few weeks and hence could become  more chary about lending now.  The staff recommends that the Board and the FOMC extend the expiring facilities through October 30.  This six-month extension from April 30 should be sufficient for now to assure market participants that the lending programs will be available for the period of time relevant for money market transactions.  A case could be made for an even longer extension to take the programs over year-end—say through January 30, 2010—but you may be concerned that such a very long extension could signal a view that the financial crisis will be quite protracted.  Also, for the programs that depend on the Board’s section 13(3) authority, the requirement to find that unusual and exigent circumstances are present may be interpreted as making it difficult to extend these programs for a full year from now.  If you do extend the facilities through expiration dates of these programs around the time of your June or August meeting so that you will be able to provide advance notice to market participants about whether or not the programs will be extended beyond October.   Some of the Federal Reserve’s special programs—for example, the TAF—do not have a set expiration date and hence do not need to be extended.  Also, the TALF is not set to expire until year-end.  Thus, under the staff proposal to extend the other 22 of 267\f",
      " expiring facilities through October 30, the TALF would not need to be extended at this time.  If the Board and the FOMC act at this meeting to extend the programs, the staff anticipates that the extensions would be announced to the public on Thursday at 10:00 a.m.  Because the swap lines are among the items proposed for extension, part of the press release would be joint with our foreign central bank counterparties.  Draft resolutions for consideration by the Board and the FOMC were included in the staff memo on this matter.  Trish will now continue our presentation. \n",

      "MS. MOSSER.  There have been a few times, certainly, that the peculiarities of the structure of the CDS market have led to more-volatile changes in spreads from one day to the next.  But, quite honestly, it is a more liquid market.  It probably gives you a truer price signal for the vast majority of credits out there, particularly large corporations, both financial and nonfinancial, than the corporate bond market does.  When market liquidity goes away and it is harder to discern fundamental movements in asset prices, the less liquid market—and that is definitely corporate bonds—gives you the worst signal, and the CDS market probably gives you a better signal.  Given the size of the CDS market, the rapidity with which it grew, the size to which it grew, and the fact that it is a little the dog that didn’t bark and that there were certainly problems with the Lehman bankruptcy and a lot of technical issues, my view is that, frankly, it has been one of the markets that has continued to function—not wonderfully, but it still functions—and some liquidity is still there.

The ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible from political pressures, so we can do what central bankers do.  I might also add as much as possible from market pressures, but that is another matter.  But I disagree with the point made—  and I agree with the staff conclusion—with regard to the purchase of Treasuries.  It strikes me that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in  fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy.  I am very reluctant to go down that road.  That strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the staff made.  At any rate, at this point I don’t think it is necessary.

A sterilized intervention, or an intervention in which you are intervening in a market and comparing that with intervening more broadly in Treasuries, is one thing.  Another thing is an intervention that is unsterilized and that does not pull some other assets out of the market.  I would just point to Ms. Mosser’s presentation, which she opened with characterizing markets as that rates in markets in which we have intervened have broadly improved and rates in markets in which we have not intervened have broadly deteriorated.

I think the hedge fund industry for the most part has weathered this remarkably well, but of course, the five biggest hedge funds, Goldman, Merrill, et cetera, et cetera, are gone.  What is left is a good deal smaller and presumably a lot less consequential than the ones we have seen. Let me just add, Mr. Chairman, that I agree 100 percent with what you just said.  We  have long had a system in which the commercial banking system has been a backup source of liquidity to other financial institutions and the nonfinancial sector as well.  For a variety of reasons, partially because of what has happened to capital and partially because the shadow banking system is growing so rapidly relative to the banking system, even though I would say banks in the aggregate are continuing to play that role, it has become increasingly difficult for them to function effectively as the backup source of liquidity.

      "MR. SICHEL.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook.”  The incoming data largely have ratified the bleak near-term outlook we projected in the December Greenbook; the spending data have painted a gloomy picture, and readings on employment and production were even weaker than we had expected.  Starting first with the employment data, the top left panel of exhibit 1 shows the dramatic worsening of the labor market in recent months.  Private payrolls declined almost 520,000 per month on average in the fourth quarter.  The panel to the right shows manufacturing industrial production excluding motor vehicles.  Factory output has been plummeting as manufacturers are responding aggressively to declines in both domestic and foreign demand.  The motor vehicle sector has been hit particularly hard.  With extremely sluggish sales, automakers have been slashing production—plotted in the middle left panel—and we anticipate a sizable further reduction in assemblies this quarter.  Turning to households, the latest data confirm that consumers continue to retrench.  As shown by the blue bars, real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles appears headed for a very large drop in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate a further the housing sector, starts (the black line in the bottom left panel) declined further last month and now are less than one-quarter of their peak level in 2006.  With the level of permits (the red line) still below starts, we expect further declines in starts in the next few months.  All told, as shown to the right, we project that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of about 5 percent last quarter.  Given the greater weakness in the employment and production data, we have lowered our forecast for the first-quarter change in real GDP to minus 5½ percent.  In the second quarter, the rate of decline in real GDP moderates as the new fiscal package—discussed more in a minute—boosts demand.  The top left panel of exhibit 2 summarizes the medium-term outlook for real activity.  We anticipate that recovery will begin, albeit slowly, in the second half of this year, with real GDP projected to increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent; next year, output is expected to rise about 2½ percent.  The box to the right lists key factors contributing to the onset of recovery:  Financial stress begins to recede, housing begins to stabilize, monetary and fiscal stimulus provide a boost to demand, and inventory liquidation comes to an end.  Regarding fiscal stimulus, although the precise composition of what will be passed remains a moving target, we now assume  a package of $800 billion, $300 billion more than what we penciled into the slightly stronger outlook for economic growth than in the last Greenbook.  The bullets in the middle left panel highlight our estimates of the response to the various provisions of the plan.  Households begin spending the tax cuts of $180 billion and transfers of $90 billion when received.  On the other hand, we expect the investment response to the business tax cuts to be limited.  In addition, of the total new funding for state and local governments, we project that only 40 percent will be spent by the                                                   2 The materials used by Mr. Sichel, Ms. Dynan, and Mr. Reeve are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).  85 of 267\f",
      "end of 2010 as infrastructure projects take some time to get under way and as the spending of other grants is smoothed out somewhat.   The panel to the right puts the pieces together.  We estimate that the fiscal package will boost real GDP growth by a bit less than 1½ percentage points this year and almost 1 percentage point next year.  Our estimates of the GDP effects are smaller than those of some other analysts, with the discrepancy mostly reflecting our assumption of slower spend-out rates by state and local governments.  Inventory dynamics—the subject of the bottom panels—are another element importantly shaping the recession and recovery.  The table in the bottom left reports the contributions of inventories to real GDP growth in key periods over the business cycle.  The first column shows the contributions in the current episode, and the second column shows averages for the postwar period.  As can be seen on line 1, in the year before the peak in real GDP in 2008:Q2, inventories were already being liquidated aggressively, in contrast to the usual positive contribution.  As shown on line 2 of the table, from the peak to the trough, inventories hold down real GDP growth only a little.  Because inventory liquidation was already quite rapid before the peak, once the contraction in sales got under way, the rate of liquidation needed to steepen only a bit more.  In contrast, during many past episodes, the drag from  inventories was much larger as manufacturers had to play catch-up once sales turned down.  In the year after the trough (line 3 of the table) liquidation comes to an end, and the swing in inventories boosts real GDP growth 1 percentage point, about in line with historical averages.  This increase in the inventory contribution is an important feature of the projected recovery in real GDP.  Karen will now discuss developments shaping the outlook for households and businesses.   \n",

What is done here is to index to the series-specific peak so that you look at each of the path cycles and say when GDP turned down in that cycle.  In many cycles, that is the same as the NBER peak, but in some cycles it is not.  In this cycle, in particular, it came a couple of quarters later.  You could do it the other way—in which case you would see the red line rising first and then coming down.  It is just a different way of presenting the same information. \n",

So far that has not happened in the commercial area, although we certainly think it is a risk.

      "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be very brief.  Our indicators and the anecdotal reports from the Fifth District are quite consistent with the national picture and the picture that emerges from the reports that we have heard around the table from the Reserve Bank Presidents so far today.  There are only three nuances that I would take note of.  One is recent couple of months of decline but potentially meaningful.  Second, on the other side, expected prices received in manufacturing have swung decisively from negative territory in November, more than minus 1 percent, to positive territory, above 1½ percent.  Third, a fairly significant manufacturing. On the national level, our outlook is basically aligned with the Greenbook, with a couple of exceptions.  I am a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth when the recovery begins.  I expect inflation to return above 1 percent later this year and to get to about 1½ percent rather than sag in the out years.  I do not think we are going to want to keep the nominal rate at the floor for nearly as long as the Greenbook expects.  I am thinking liftoff is likely sometime in 2010 rather than in 2012. I endorse the statements made by Presidents Evans and Stern and others about the depressing effect of the lack of clarity around government credit policy.  Capital injections that have occurred so far and prospects for future capital injections seem to have induced a tipping dynamic by which we are at a corner solution—there is no private equity coming in for fear of what future capital injections might do to them, and so we are left with the public sector being the only source of prospective capital.  Looking ahead at the strategy, I think we want to get to a point where the banks are healthy, which means they can raise equity privately.  That transition 144 of 267\f",
      "is the hard one to solve, and I endorse the ideas that President Stern just alluded to.

      "MR. MADIGAN.  As Spence Hilton noted, it could be very useful to have an additional tool for draining substantial volumes of reserves from the banking system  and shrinking the monetary base.  Either the issuance of Fed bills or an enhanced supplementary financing program run by the Treasury on behalf of the Federal Reserve could be particularly helpful.  The staff has drafted legislative language that  would authorize these tools.  Because the Treasury would have a substantial interest  in such programs, and because we would need the Treasury’s support in advancing such legislation, we have been discussing this subject with the Treasury.  Our presumption is that we would not seek legislation both for Fed bills and for an enhanced SFP.  Rather, we and the Treasury together would raise both possibilities with the relevant congressional committees to discuss the substance and the political prospects for each.  On the basis of those discussions, one approach or the other would be advanced.    To give adequate assurance to the Federal Reserve and to the markets that these tools will provide the capability to tighten monetary policy as necessary and when necessary, the tools would have to be effectively under the Federal Reserve’s control.  Two possible constraints are of particular concern:  the public debt ceiling, and possible interference by a future Treasury.  To ensure that a binding debt ceiling does not disrupt the conduct of monetary policy, Fed bills or Treasury bills issued under an enhanced SFP program would have to be excluded from the debt ceiling.  And to ensure that a future Treasury could not block the implementation of appropriate monetary policy, the Federal Reserve either will need to be able to issue its own obligations as it sees fit to carry out its statutory mandate, or it will need to be able to direct the Treasury to do so as its proxy.      However, the Congress may see the exclusion of Fed bills or SFP obligations from the debt ceiling as an unwarranted dilution of the congressional responsibility to appropriate government monies and to authorize the issuance of federal debt.  And we recognize that the Treasury is concerned about the potential for issuance of such securities to interfere with the Treasury’s responsibility for managing the public debt.      Draft legislation prepared by the staff would assign the primary responsibility within the Federal Reserve for the issuance of Fed bills or SFP bills to the Federal Open Market Committee.  This seems appropriate because the main purpose of the tool, as we see it, is to ensure the capability of the FOMC to tighten monetary policy when appropriate.  We see Fed bills as a tool on the liabilities side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that would essentially be symmetric with our asset-side open    The legislation should also address several other key issues.  In that regard, we have included the following specific elements in the draft legislation we sent to the Treasury:     First, Fed bills would be full faith and credit obligations of the United States in order to maximize their acceptability to investors, to make them as close   20 of 266\f",
      "          substitutes as possible for Treasury securities, and to minimize the interest expense of such obligations.    Second, for similar reasons, Fed bills should not be subject to state and local income taxes.    Third, the Treasury has suggested a statutory maximum maturity of Fed bills in order to limit interference with Treasury debt management.  We have recommended a maximum maturity of one year.  Treasury staff members prefer a shorter maximum term.    Finally, we have recommended that the Fed not be required to notify the Treasury a fixed number of days before issuing Fed bills or scheduling issuance of SFP bills, but rather that the legislation indicate qualitatively that issuance of Fed bills or SFP bills should minimize interference with the conduct of the Treasury’s regular debt management responsibilities.  As President Plosser and others have noted, there are pros and cons to the Fed bills and expanded SFP proposals.  And even with the support of the Administration, the political prospects for such legislation are not clear at this stage.  It is possible that the Federal Reserve may need to accept some changes to the draft legislation to obtain passage.  One possible change that might help make the program acceptable to all interested parties would be a sunset provision under which the authority to issue such obligations expires after, say, five years.  \n",

      "MR. NELSON.  I’ll do the best I can.  First of all, this is something that we’ve been allowing the private sector to develop.  It’s not like some of these other instances where we’ve worked with the private sector to develop special purpose vehicles like the MMIFF.  These are private sector efforts.  These things first came up in discussions when we were trying to think of ways to make the program useful for real money investors.  Part of the challenge in the TALF is that the objective is to encourage an investor class that normally hasn’t invested in asset-backed securities to move into that space, namely, leveraged investors.  Traditionally, asset-backed securities have been held by real money investors, like pension funds and insurance companies.  So we were trying to think of ways that the program could be made more attractive for those investors.  One way to do that would be to have a special purpose vehicle purchase the asset-backed securities and take the loan and raise the haircut part of that transaction by issuing equity.  That equity could conceivably be a tradable security which could be invested in by real money investors. When we looked at that a month or so ago, it didn’t necessarily seem as if it was going to be successful, though my understanding is that it has gotten more momentum in recent weeks.  In particular, the one thing that I think would really make it take off would be if those equity tranches could be rated by the credit rating agencies, and I am not sure where that effort stands. Another reason these special purpose vehicles came up was our requirement that we only lend to U.S. entities.  Many hedge funds are actually foreign entities, but we viewed it as acceptable (and I may not get this exactly right) if there was a U.S. arm of that entity with a U.S. operation—an actual person, a manager there—that would be a U.S. entity that we could lend to.  So to some extent there was an effort to set up vehicles along those lines.  Then, lastly, there has been interest in potentially insulating the financial institution from some things like the H-1B  22 of 266\f",

I think that eliminating that risk in a really short period of time is probably unrealistic, considering the size and scope of operations, including very traditional banking operations—which, we all know, are subject to runs—that several of these institutions have in many countries.  And many of those countries do not have, for example, the deposit insurance schemes that the United States does, which means the institutions are more vulnerable there.  I think the possibility of completely shutting down and eliminating the risk in a short period of time is probably unrealistic, although movement in that direction is a good idea. \n",

It seems—both from  our MBS purchase program and from the U.K.’s announcement—that a huge amount of the interest rate effect happens on announcement, not on execution.  It doesn’t grow over time as the purchases get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Boom—the rates fall.  Discerning spread changes from the purchase levels is very tricky business, and so is the macro effect—I wouldn’t venture there.  But that announcement effect happens because of the assumption that the central banks are going to keep buying for a while, not that they’re just going to do it for a month or two and then stop the program and go away.  I am fairly certain that in the U.S. we’ll see that reaction in mortgage spreads—if the determination was made to stop in July, the forward rates in July would pop right up and we’d be back to approximately where we were in January.

      "MR. EVANS.  It sounds like it’s aimed at getting us out of the current situation, and I think that’s a good idea.  But over the next 30 years, our ability to have that authority might be a problem.  In reading your testimony on the 13(3) authority and the grilling that you got, I don’t recall anybody who thought it was a great idea that the Fed had the authority to undertake this on their own, and they wouldn’t admit that they knew that this was possible, at least according to what I had read.  So I just wonder, would a future accord be a 13(3)-type of activity that causes us to acquire these assets, and then we’d need to issue bills?  I guess I’m just wondering under  what circumstances we would issue bills. I think the lasting lesson from all of this is that we don’t want to get here again, that we ought to conduct policy in a way to avoid this.  Future regulatory changes that might help out are obviously one way, market discipline is another, and responding to large changes in asset prices that we don’t understand very well might be another.  But keeping the average level of the fed funds rate at a place where we don’t expect to hit the zero bound again might be much more attractive now, having gone through this, so that might be something we should talk about at some point.  If along the way you could get an explicit numerical price objective out of this, that would be quite good.  And then, lastly, let me ask another question.  If the likely take-up on our TALF for the legacy assets is low, and given the prudent central bank lending that we are doing (at least according to the people I talk to in the marketplace; they don’t find this very attractive),  is the Treasury going to be satisfied with that?

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On the swap lines, I do think that we  could put in the minutes that it’s basically procedural—it’s symmetric with what other foreign central banks have done with us.  I would argue for being transparent.  We need to be prepared for foreign funding problems, and I think it just makes sense to be clear on it. In terms of the resolution of holding companies, which ties into the foreign swap lines, I think that’s as important an issue as the Fed bills, and I think trying to find a way to push resolution makes sense.  If you could argue that, if we had the resolution powers now we could be doing much more effective things with AIG, there may be a hook to actually move things along more quickly.  I don’t know where our thinking is, but I see this as a chance to try to push that, particularly if it would give us an opportunity to abrogate contracts in the event that we or somebody else had resolution power.  But I think we should try to move that just as quickly as the Fed bills. In terms of the removal of problem assets, I agree that’s a critical component.  I strongly agree that we shouldn’t be doing ring-fencing institution by institution, so I’m glad we’re moving away from that strategy.  I think the first-best solution would be more aggressive write-downs of assets, creating a bad bank for the most troubled banks.  I think it’s a much more straightforward solution, and I realize that it does mean much more capital for some banks because we will be taking aggressive action.  But I think that, just as we shouldn’t have banks deferring losses, we, as the central bank and the Treasury, shouldn’t defer losses if they’re really on the balance sheet.  The first-best solution, I think, is to try to work with the bad bank solution. The TALF for problem legacy assets—I think we shouldn’t make these programs particularly voluntary.  If we’re going in and forcing write-downs, and the write-downs are fairly significant, the banks are going to want to participate in the program, because they will have  76 of 266\f",
      "already taken the losses.  So, instead of trying to make it voluntary, I think we should have the write-downs be severe enough that they’re going to want to get the assets off their balance sheets because they’ve already taken the losses and they’re not trying to defer additional losses.  Thinking about how we can have a supervisory strategy that guarantees that outcome might make it much easier than hoping that people volunteer their portfolios.  To the extent that we can do that, that would be my preferred option. In terms of the policy, I think this is the time to be very aggressive.  I strongly prefer option A in the Bluebook, or possibly even a little bit larger, as Vice Chairman Dudley has suggested—I’d be open to that as well.  We’re far from reaching either element of the dual  mandate over the forecast horizon.  This is the time to push rates down.  We have a new program from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that’s going to include refinancing.  The refinancing involves paying closing costs.  Now is the time to push the rates down, so that the people who are refinancing and participate in that program only have to pay the closing costs one time.  It will also square us with some of the other issues in terms of encouraging servicers to come up with solutions.  It’s also spring—the right time for the housing sector, and we do need the housing sector to start bottoming out, getting people back into the market.  If we push rates down significantly right now, I think many people will start coming off the sidelines, because even if they don’t think prices have hit bottom, they will probably think interest rates are at an all-time low and they may want to take advantage of that.  So I think it’s a very good time to be doing that. I do have concerns that the TALF is off to a slow start.  When I talk to hedge funds, they’re quite skeptical about how successful that program is going to be.  We’ve been kind of relying on that as possibly being a successful policy tool.  Because I’m a little more skeptical  77 of 266\f",

Mindful of the fact that I’m now the major impediment between the Federal Open Market Committee and dinner, I will follow President Lockhart’s lead and confine myself to comments on the large-scale asset-purchase issue.

      "MS. DUKE.  Now I’m the one standing in the way of dinner.  I just want to talk a bit about expansion of the TALF and then also about asset purchases.  In terms of expanding the TALF, my concern is about some of the asset classes, for instance, commercial-mortgage-backed  securities.  I don’t know a lot about how those are put together, but I do know a lot about commercial mortgages, and they’re much closer to business loans than they are to real estate loans.  They’re entirely dependent on cash flows of different types of businesses.  So if we get into those kinds of purchases and we start to determine the haircuts, we’re going to be looking at credit allocation, because we’re going to be looking at differences in conditions in different industries and the real estate that supports those industries. The second thing is that I don’t think you can make a bad asset into a good one by taking a larger haircut.  If we’re going to be taking assets not from banks, but from anybody who wants to disgorge them, then what would keep us from simply moving assets from one hedge fund to another?  And I really get concerned that the Fed ends up getting stuck trying to digest every hairball that’s out there in the marketplace.  [Laughter]  That’s a technical term, “hairball.” I also worry that when we originally talked about expanding the TALF up to $1 trillion, it was with the understanding that that was conditional upon our getting the ability to issue either Fed bills or the supplemental Treasury securities.  That has gotten lost in the discussion of it, and I worry that with a quick announcement on this other facility, the notion would again get lost, namely, that it’s dependent upon other things happening. Finally, I don’t see this as a good bank–bad bank situation, and I worry whether we’d have enough left to deal with emergencies if they came up.  I’ll talk more about this tomorrow, but the more I keep going around and around considering all the things we’re trying to do to fix the banking system—while I think it’s important—I’m not nearly as confident as everyone else  109 of 266\f",
      "that it’s something that we can do.  So I keep coming back to thinking that the only thing we can do is to put a floor under house prices.  If we could put a floor under house prices, that would also put a floor under bank losses, and I think it’s our best chance to get moving in the right direction. Before I move to asset purchases, I’d like to start with the story of an elderly wealthy gentleman who had taken a young bride and begun to spend money like crazy.  His friends got very concerned that he was going to go through his entire fortune, and they elected one of their number to go and talk to him about it.  He said, “Sam, we’re really concerned.  We want to make sure that you know that you can’t buy love.”  Sam said, “I know you can’t buy love, but if you spend enough money, you can buy something that looks so close you can hardly tell the difference.”  [Laughter]  So I think if we spent enough money, got enough of a hit right now, it would look like a floor on house prices, and we might have something every bit as good as a floor on house prices.  It seems like the best time, when we have the synergies with the housing program, which should reduce foreclosures and should increase the ability to refinance.  Both borrowers and purchasers are so incredibly hair-trigger sensitive to what goes on with mortgage interest rates.  Mortgage interest rates went down when we made the announcement before, but that was in November, and that was not the season when people buy houses.  If we do this in the spring, when there are other programs that would support it and when it’s pretty obvious that there’s not going to be any fiscal stimulus coming along that would also further support house purchases, then maybe we’ve got a window of opportunity where we can go in there and put a floor under house prices, and that will start to move some of these other things.  And with that, Mr. Chairman, I believe I’m the last one.  110 of 266\n",

      "MR. FISHER.  I was first going to say to Dave Stockton that our wives have an affinity for T-shirts.  My wife, a smart Wellesley woman who spent most of her time at MIT, arrived at Oxford noting that the ratio of women to men was 1 to 11.  She had a T-shirt for other women which she sold briskly, and it said, “Come to Oxford where the odds are good, but the goods are odd.”  [Laughter] else.”  [Laughter] Mr. Chairman, I want to report on the microeconomic input I received from my corporate contacts, which numbered some 29 CEOs around the country whom I talked to before this meeting.  Unfortunately, it confirms what Dave and Steve presented.  In fact, one actually called me and said, “Do you want some good news?”  And I said, “Please.”  He said, “Call somebody   As to our District, we have fallen finally into recession.  We created jobs last year.  I believe we are the only District that did create jobs last year, or had jobs created in the District.   The cut is less severe—it will take fewer stitches to mend—but, nonetheless, we have been cut. As to the national economy, my favorite indicators are all negative.  There are 175,000 railcars that are out of commission.  There has been some improvement in bulk shipping rates, but that is a head fake according to shippers I have talked to, because of the extraordinary purchase of iron ore that China undertook recently—in fact, record amounts.  If you look at containers and other shipping indicators, these are all flat to negative.  Of the world’s large aircraft fleet, 20 percent—that’s 2,800 airplanes—are now sitting unused in the desert.  If you look at Boeing’s numbers, it received only four orders for new aircraft versus several hundred last February.  And I’m told by my contacts in the airline industry that the Chinese government has ordered all of their carriers not to take the liberty of buying a single plane in 2009.  That from one of the largest net new buyers of aircraft in the world.  123 of 266\f",
      "There is very little cap-ex taking place.  In fact, every corporate contact I spoke to, from  the large manufacturers to even Disney, is cutting back on cap-ex and displaying all kinds of  microeconomic behavioral patterns that indicate the kind of deflationary trap that my colleague just spoke about.  We’ve talked about them before, but the essence is they are withholding They’re also withholding decisions because they are confused.  And you see this in some of the data from those that touch many consumers in the country, as well.  For example, according to AT&T, its large enterprise business has just stopped; its small business demand is in decline; its 800 services are down.  And, very interestingly, overall minutes are declining significantly.  One of the indications of movement of people is roaming minutes.  Roaming minutes domestically  and internationally, according to the CEO of AT&T, have come to a screeching halt. The picture is similar if you talk to people in the travel and entertainment business, which I do like to look at.  If you aggregate it properly, not just airline travel, not just hotels, but sports and entertainment and all that derives from it, it’s a significantly sized industry.  According to Disney’s CEO, travel and entertainment is down 46 percent year-over-year in February.  That’s confirmed by the number of credit card transactions, which are up, but the total amount is down.  According to the CEO of JCPenney, whom I’m fortunate to have on my board, this is going to manifest itself in further contraction, with particular risk in the commercial real estate area.  The chairman of the retail federation estimates that, of 1,100 major malls in the United States, a third will fail over the course of the next three years.  This is not happy news.  Part of it has to do with the lack of debtor-in-possession financing.  Without DIP financing, you accelerate the process.  And I don’t know how we are ever going to deal with that situation.  124 of 266\f",
      "I couldn’t find any silver linings.  There is, I suppose, a pewter lining, as I like to call it.  And, Governor Tarullo, without any insult to your industry, one of the virtues is that the legal industry is also contracting [laughter]; 6,000 people were laid off from major law firms year to date.  There’s a website that actually tracks this.  What’s interesting about it is that the transaction business has dried up and is not being compensated for by the bankruptcy business.  I think the reason the bankruptcy business is not proceeding is because debtor-in-possession financing is very hard to come by and remains a problem. There’s also another pewter lining in the Wal-Mart reports:  Gas price declines have added $120 to $130 per customer per month.  The CEO, however, noted some inflation in apparel prices thus far this year, but they believe that is also a head fake, because they can tell from their own inventory that eventually those prices will have to come down. So overall, Mr. Chairman, the situation is bleak.  The key underlying weak factor that I hear about from CEO after CEO, from microeconomic operator after microeconomic operator, big or small, is a lack of confidence.  When I first walked onto the training floors of Brown Brothers 37 years ago, Robert Roosa gave me a quote that I haven’t forgotten, which came from James Madison:  “The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.”  There is no confidence. I want to come back to a statement I made yesterday, and I’ll withhold my comments on policy until the next round.  In order to instill confidence, first, it takes time and, second, you have to exhibit competence.  And in order to exhibit competence, I think you have to keep things simple.  I came away from yesterday’s session deeply concerned about our conversation about the TALF and the complexity with which we’re engaging in policy.  And I hope we can figure out a way to do what we do in the simplest, most communicative manner possible.  I’m worried  125 of 266\f",

      "MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Not surprisingly, my assessment of the economy and the financial sector converges with those that have already been expressed.  So let me just quickly make a few additional observations that support the hypothesis of an even longer period for stabilization and recovery than reflected in the Greenbook forecast and, thus, even greater vulnerability for the economy for some time to come. I begin with an admittedly speculative point about the domestic labor market, but one that complements some earlier comments by Presidents Yellen and Evans.  It appears to me that an unusual number of industries will be undergoing major structural adjustments during the course of this downturn and, as a result, may not rehire at the rate that might be expected in a cyclical rebound.  These industries are two groups.  One consists of industries like construction and financial services that were directly involved in the asset bubbles associated with the financial crisis.  It seems likely that overcapacity in those industries so far exceeded sustainable demand that the post-recession employment profile will be substantially, rather than just moderately, below pre-crisis levels.  A second group consists of industries that, even in the middle part of the diverse as autos, media, legal services, and retail were already in the process of consolidation and/or downsizing.  This process has clearly accelerated under the weight of the contraction in real GDP.  There are good reasons—anecdotal, I admit, but good reasons, nonetheless—to believe that, to a greater or lesser degree, each of these industries will emerge from this recession permanently leaner than they were, and some may be fundamentally changed.  This observation is, as I noted, to date unsupported by even raw data, much less by systematic comparison with earlier severe recessions.  But if my intuition is buttressed by such an analysis, elevated unemployment levels may be stickier for a longer time than we now anticipate.  The emergence  161 of 266\f",
      "of new firms and industries that might normally be expected to pick up some of the slack will, at the same time, be hindered by continuing dysfunction in financial markets. I have some very different observations about the international economy, but, I’m afraid, with similar implications for the shape of the GDP growth curve.  The downward revisions of economic performance abroad do not seem to have been met with a sense of policy urgency in many countries, particularly with respect to non-monetary policy measures in the advanced foreign economies.  Indeed, my conclusion from my week in Europe was not dissimilar to that of Governor Warsh.  I observed, in addition, that there has been a kind of collective decision among policymakers to put on a relatively happy face publicly, while being unable privately to offer any grounds for optimism.  In formal comments and public utterances, a number of policymakers made reference to wholly adequate stimulus measures.  They discounted the significance of increased bank CDS spreads, or, in at least one case, commented on the wonderful bargains available to those who still had jobs.  This attitude is of particular concern because, as Steve Kamin mentioned, the effects of stimulus measures in many advanced foreign economies are substantially front-loaded into 2009. Whether because of policy paralysis in the face of daunting challenges or, in some cases,  because of the weak political circumstances of incumbent governments, too many countries seem unable or unwilling to elevate their responses to rapidly deteriorating conditions.  I worry that a similar hesitancy to take forceful steps could lead to inadequate responses to contingencies, such as widespread banking problems in emerging markets.  An absence of confidence in the political strength of the government can also push officials towards more serious consideration of measures, such as shifts in foreign exchange policies, which may relieve a certain amount of domestic pain by shifting it elsewhere in a neutral or even negative-sum fashion.  162 of 266\f",
      "My concerns about this issue have increased dramatically in the last week.  Many emerging markets have limited capacity to help themselves, given their own fiscal and monetary constraints.  One major exception, of course, is China.  Yet even China seems to be relying in the medium term on a rebound in advanced foreign economies that would restore many of the exports lost in recent months.  While that approach worked well for countries coming out of the Asian financial crisis in 1999, it was built on the strength of largely unaffected American and European economies.  Obviously, demand in our economies will be weak for quite some time.  Moreover, the continued problems in our financial sectors imply that capital flows to emerging Despite these impediments to a reasonably fast-paced return to conditions promoting rapid emerging market growth, there’s little indication in China or elsewhere that policymakers have used the crisis to accelerate shifts in their own growth models away from a high level of export dependence.  Coupled with what is, at least for the present, a somewhat passive policy instinct in some advanced economies, international developments may, like our domestic employment situation, suggest a more prolonged and shaky recovery period.

My preference for Treasuries is not particularly driven by a desire to push down long-term  interest rates so much as it is by a desire to help manage the composition of our balance sheet.  I’m not as worried about the effect on inflation expectations of buying Treasuries, in part because, if there is a concern about expectations of inflation, it’s that I really don’t want them to fall.  So I am not too worried about that aspect of it, and I do prefer Treasuries.

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  This was the most depressing go-round in a year and a half, and this was a really bad year and a half, so it highlights that we’re far away from where we want to be, both in inflation and in unemployment.  And in terms of communicating with the public, I think that’s what we’re communicating to the public:  We’re not where we want to be, and we want to get there as quickly as we can. I don’t think simple rules on the balance sheet or the monetary base are appropriate.  These are different programs for different problems.  If the interbank market is disrupted, I would expect swaps and TAF to go up.  If we have a real problem in other areas, I’d want to do significant asset purchases.  These are not substitutes, and just having either a balance sheet or a monetary base rule is assuming that these programs are substitutes for each other.  They’re dealing with different problems. I think this is an opportune time to push down rates as significantly as we can.  I think we should be very aggressive.  I think everybody’s discussion around the table indicated we should be aggressive.  I like the idea of heavily weighting on MBS purchases; I think that will be the most effective.  I also like the idea that, if we’re going to try to get the most bang for the buck, given that these are experimental programs, we ought to try at least to see what happens with the Treasuries as well.  So my preference would be to do the combination of A and B, which is the $1.15 trillion total, to try to have as big an effect as possible.

      "MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.  As we talk about this statement, I think it’s sadly ironic that, after we’ve doubled the size of our balance sheet, we’re having a conversation about being worried that it may shrink a little bit.  It’s incredible to me that we would have that.  And I agree with what Governor Kohn said in that I don’t think we should start talking 10 percent monthly growth or whatever it is.  We’re trying to deal with a broken intermediation and banking system  at the same time, and I don’t think we can turn it into a monetary policy instrument in terms of how much we expect the balance sheet to grow at this point. With that, I would say I am much more in favor of statement B as we had it.  I would admit that the banking system is broken.  That’s part of the reason we’re doing the TALF.  If we’re going to expand and we’re going to address the broken intermediation process, we should focus on mortgage-backeds.  That’s what the idea was to begin with.  Let’s stick with it.  If we now introduce Treasuries into that (1) I think it’s only going to be confusing, and (2) I think we do have to look long term.  Our introducing purchases of longer-term securities farther along the yield curve sets a precedent, and I don’t think it’s easy to back off from that once we get through this mess we’re in right now.  So that’s why I prefer B. I also want to take just a minute and talk about the legacy TALF.  There’s reference to  populist reaction to this, and I actually think that this reaction is justified in important ways.  We ought to think about that, because people are now confused between TARP and TALF, and I think when we add the legacy TALF, it’s going to confuse things even more.  The reason that they’re reacting to it is TARP.  I agree that it was necessary to keep from having a meltdown, but the execution of it was so confusing and so inequitable across the system that it created great backlash.  Some of the backlash was very justified—for example, when you have some banks being told, “You’re going to take it,” and a thousand other banks being told, “You can beg for  200 of 266\f",
      "it,” and following that up with changing the rules, you’re not going to get anything but a backlash.  I think that’s important to keep in mind. So as we think about going forward, I come back to President Fisher’s point about needing a decision tree on how we’re going to deal with these legacy assets.  Our getting involved in the legacy TALF, as I’ve heard it described to this point, is, I think, very risky—very dangerous, almost—in terms of what the outcomes might be, because there aren’t clear, defined clarified before we have another reaction like the one we had recently. Finally, I do want to come back to something Governor Kohn mentioned yesterday in reference to my comment about using excess reserves to help manage the balance sheet and set the rate floor.  I know that it got off to a rough start, but I think we are getting our sea legs and the industry is getting their sea legs.  If we start issuing Fed bills, I think we are introducing another tool that will start out with the best intentions, but expectations will be raised, how we use it will be brought into account, questions will arise about trying to get around debt ceilings and so forth.  I think we should try to avoid that if we can and see if we can use our interest on excess reserves as a management tool.  So with those comments, I’ll again say I’d go with B.  Thank you. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let’s try to put this all together.  Most importantly, I think there’s a pretty strong consensus for the combined package, the total of $1.15 trillion.  I heard the point about doing even more in Treasuries.  I guess I think that just crossing the Rubicon will have a significant announcement effect, because it will signal our willingness to do more if necessary in the future.  I am a little concerned about misinterpretation of what we’re doing, so I guess I would like to propose to stay where we are for the moment.  We can always change it. I very much appreciate the contribution from Presidents Plosser and Bullard.  I don’t think we’re quite ready to go there, but I do think we can start communicating in that way and start trying to talk about percentages as we talk in speeches and other contexts.  I think, in particular, since we want to front-load, it’s hard to put it in percentage terms at the moment.  And I think that to get the maximum effect in the short run that Governor Duke talked about, it would be better to have a headline number.  But I think it’s actually a very constructive point, and we should think about ways to move in that direction if we can. So what I propose is to start from alternative B.  I think it’s reasonable to do either B or B′, but I didn’t hear a huge amount of demand to go to B′.  I heard the concerns about the first   paragraph.  What if we say that “the economy continues to contract,” as some suggested? “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates the economy continues to contract,” period, and we’d drop “the outlook has worsened” as well.  Then, if you like, we could drop, say, the sentence that starts with “Weaker sales prospects,” but I think that is consistent with our previous style in trying to describe elements of the economy.  Then I would note that we have a somewhat optimistic ending in this paragraph.  So I don’t think  215 of 266\f",

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on the mortgage-backed-security purchase program, in particular looking at figure 13 and figure 14.  Figure 13 shows that the mortgage rates have come down as you discussed, and what’s striking to me is that it looks as though we accounted for roughly 80 percent of the issuance of mortgage-backed securities over the first four months of the year.  If we had been willing to buy 100 percent of the issuance, I assume that we would have been a price setter in that market and we would have had the ability to push rates even further down.  So my question is, (A) Is that accurate, and (B) if our guidance to the Desk was to try to get the retail rate between 4 and 4¼ percent, do you think we would be able to do that for the new issuance?  As you’ve highlighted, we account for most of the coupon purchases between 4 and 5 percent.  So if, instead, we had instructions that we’re really intending to try to get that rate down, would you be able to hit it? \n",

      "MS. MOSSER.  In the short run, they probably take some capital gains, in point of fact.  The big question is when they would come back and how quickly.  The experience of central banks completely taking over markets to the point that the market is effectively shut except for what the central bank is buying is not so pretty from a liquidity standpoint.  For example, in Japan it took a year and a half to get their money market to work again in any kind of normal way, and that was a money market, not a relatively complex product like MBS.  I think the big question is, if we completely dominate the trading in this market, we can probably set whatever price we want, but if there are no other buyers that will complicate things for the originators in the following sense.  Originators will have to be very certain about how much we’re going to buy, the price, and the point at which we’re going to exit.  As long as  they’re very certain about the price and we buy absolutely everything, they’ll have no problem originating at low rates.  But the minute there’s any hint that we’re not going to buy every last dollar, there’s uncertainty about what they can sell to someone else.  At that point it’s going to be much harder for them to hedge their pipeline, and the spread between the secondary rate and the primary rate may be wider.  So I think there’s a concern that perhaps the spread could widen out despite our best efforts to drag the secondary rate down.  The short story is that there is a bit of a tradeoff between how low we can push the secondary-market rate and how much we want to preserve some liquidity in the market so that we have an exit strategy. \n",

On CMBS, our understanding, in talking to the investors and the syndicators, is that the new-issue CMBS are obviously a substantially smaller pool of possible loans and securitizations than the legacy.  Opening it up to legacy actually makes the larger number seem, at least relative to take-up so far, more possible.

      "MR. HOENIG.  Let me start with the District, and I’ll be brief.  I have talked to several dozen people in the region, and I have not had a single one tell me that they think things are improving.  But what I do hear is that things are not getting any worse except for a couple of areas.  One of those areas is natural gas production, which if those rigs are moving your way, I’d look at them pretty carefully before I put them in production, given the price of natural gas right now.  The other is commercial real estate.  There is a lot of angst about commercial real estate in the region.  It is under pressure.  Projects are on hold and have been stopped.  A lot of banks are holding this stuff, and a lot of them have pretty heavy concentrations of it, which gives me pause.  On the other hand, when they say things are not getting worse, there are some indications of manufacturing beginning to stabilize, some retail sales beginning to stabilize, and even some of the housing, even though it is down from a year ago, in the last couple of months has shown  some stability as well in the region. About the national outlook—I think that, as we go through the rest of this year and into next year, we will see things improve.  There are a couple of positive forces and then one thing that I consider a real negative.  The two positives are that, as we see inventories and values adjust, people then will begin to move forward.  Complementing that is the fact that the stimulus package is starting to flow.  We’re seeing a lot of highway projects really getting going, especially in our region.  The one thing that I find interesting is the value of subsidies because, as the ethanol industry is collapsing, we are now in the wind tunnel—seeing enormous amounts of investment on wind energy being placed there.  There is no way to get it out yet, but they are building these towers by the thousands, and that is adding a lot of activity in the rural areas, particularly of our region. 78 of 201\f",
      "The negative is the credit and banking conditions.  There is a fair amount of capital in these banks, but when you see their asset issues and their uncertainty around those assets, they  are conserving that capital and they are holding back on lending.  Another part of this is, as we have introduced each new plan—whether it was the PPIP or whatever—money has gone to the sidelines to see how that is going to evolve.  That has made things slower than they might have otherwise been, and I think we need to be aware of that. As you boil all of this down, I think the stimulus will be a big plus as we move through this year and into next.  As we stabilize, there’s a real upside, but the credit market banking level is a big risk going forward.  I don’t think we’ve begun at all to address the commercial real estate problems that are just wreaking havoc.  Thank you. \n",

I also like the wording in the sense that the Committee under any of these is prepared to adjust the timing and the amounts.  If you think about how much the projections have changed in the Greenbook, for example, from the last meeting to this meeting and if we are near the bottom, things could change, and I think the Committee would need to reconsider even the amounts at another meeting.  The wording in the B alternative allows us to do this. I did note and am very much appreciative of the work that the staff did on the projections on the balance sheet because I think it does point out that, if we go to these sizes, we have some  real challenges ahead of us.  I think the June meeting is extremely important in terms of thinking about an exit strategy.  That’s very important because, if we do achieve the total amount under the mortgage-backed securities, our holdings will be larger than those of either Fannie or  Freddie, and that’s a striking statement as far as our role in the economy goes.  That gives me some pause.  So B is fine.  I hope that the next meeting will show even more positive news and we can adjust these numbers going forward.  Thank you. \n",

I think part of the confusion here is that we do a program  and the market is also evaluating whether the program is effective, and then how are we going to react to the perception of the effectiveness of the program?  So if we do a program and the to assume that, gee, it worked pretty well for the Federal Reserve, so of course the Federal Reserve is likely to want to do more of it.  Their view is conditioned not just on the macroeconomic outlook but also on how the markets respond to the program.  In this particular case of the Treasury securities, I think that the market expects that the program is going to be expanded because (1) we did expand the MBS purchase program and so they’ve already seen that, when the market seems to get the desired response, the Fed has responded by increasing the size of the program and (2) they’ve seen that the Treasury program seems to have worked in the desired way that we intended.

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I was saying yesterday on the economic outlook, my judgment is just that we’re going to have to see more data at this point.  As many people around the table noted, turning points are notoriously hard to predict.  And when the economy is down, as Governor Tarullo and others noted, it is vulnerable to further shocks, which might come from directions that are not contemplated right now.  I’m also probably more pessimistic about financial markets than most here.  I think they probably have not improved all that much, and I guess I would not put too much weight on stock price movements.  These are the guys that brought us the tech bubble, remember?  They just fluctuate way too much to take  them as much of a signal in the short term.  So I think the basic mode for this meeting is that we probably need more information.  As many people, including President Pianalto and others, emphasized, we’d like to see how these stress tests come out.  This is a big near-term issue for  the Fed, and we’d like to see what happens there. A critical issue for this Committee is how the Fed bills are going to go and how they are going to move through the Congress, as the Chairman was talking about yesterday.  I’d also like to hear more about interest on reserves and related issues—possible sterilization techniques—to be discussed at the June meeting.  That may change the framework of discussion around here dramatically if we can think about those things and make more progress on those issues. On policy, we were very aggressive last time—appropriately so, I think.  Part of the argument around the table was that it was a timing issue with respect to housing and mortgage as we go through the spring here.  Any further commitments that we would make on asset purchases at this point would seem to apply mostly to a date in the future—say, the October– 133 of 201\f",
      "the information we have today.  We could make that commitment at a future meeting when we have better information on how the economy is progressing.  Also, alternative A, as I’ve been arguing, does something I haven’t liked—it contains what seem to me to be arbitrary round numbers of asset purchases.  I do agree with President Yellen that outcomes are certainly bad; and the fact is, as the Chairman was noting, in September–October this economy experienced a very large, very real shock, and the economy is going to have to adjust to that shock.  Optimal policy can mitigate and help that adjustment, but it cannot offset it completely.  So our job is to figure out how much and what is the optimal path that we can calculate that will help as much as we can help.  But I think there are probably limits to what monetary policy can do in the face of a very large and global shock. Of the many B alternatives, I like B′′, but I’m willing to entertain the discussion around the table here.  A lot of good ideas are being mentioned here on this.  So as I said before, I would like to see policy expressed as a state-contingent rule to the extent possible.  What we should have in our heads is a Taylor-type rule for asset purchases.  In a Taylor-type rule you do not say what you are going to do with the funds rate in the future.  You say, “Here’s the rule; here’s how we react to developments in the economy.”  Everyone understands this, this informs the entire equilibrium, and that’s how the equilibrium works.  We could maybe do the same kind of thing for asset purchases and say that this is how we are going to react to incoming events and on inflation, the output gap, and maybe other variables that we think are important, and that will inform the entire equilibrium and this is how we go forward.  Inside models, that is actually the optimal way to proceed.  I would like to try to get—and we have been doing a lot, and the staff has done a lot, which I appreciate—more in that direction in a difficult environment when we have a lot of challenges in front of us.  So that would be one way to implement what I would 134 of 201\f",
      "interpret as the key lesson from optimal monetary policy in the past 20 or 25 years in academic  circles, as President Plosser and others have talked about. I like the emphasis that the Committee has adopted in a lot of the discussion here that we’re concerned mainly about the persistent components of balance sheet expansion—agency MBS, Treasuries, and agency debt—and that it is the key issue going forward.  I like thinking of those as one group, which some of the staff memos did—it’s a great way to think about it.  I also have the idea that I floated a bit yesterday that, for the more temporary programs—the liquidity programs—to price them all as backstops just a little outside what would make all the volumes fall to zero.  Those programs would stay in place, but then they would all get off the balance sheet, and you would not be clouding up your balance sheet with these temporary liquidity programs.  They would still be there as a backstop; and if financial turmoil intensified, they’d be there to be used.  But you’d have the idea that these things are used in time increments of weeks, not months or years.  I think we should think about that, but maybe I’m the only one who thinks  that we should. The temporary expansion of the balance sheet or the monetary base or asset purchases even over many months is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on inflation in the medium term.  We know that the effect of any policy depends importantly on the private-sector expectations of that policy—that is, on the whole policy path.  If we do not define a policy path, the market will form expectations anyway and define a path for us, and so I think we should be clear in our own heads about what we are trying to do, what we think the optimal policy path looks like, and why.  It’s a state-contingent path.  As I stressed yesterday, surprise announcements are not a characteristic of optimal policy as I understand it.  Good policy is a state-contingent plan that is 135 of 201\f",
      "well understood by the private sector.  Most announcement effects tend to go away and might mislead us on what the impact of policy really is. So I think the bottom line is that we should stand pat for today.  We should get more information on the economy, on the stress tests, on the Fed bills possibility, and on other sterilization techniques.  I’d also like to look into the backstop pricing for liquidity programs.  I’ll stop there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. CARPENTER.  I do.  The logic underlying it, such as it was, was that the use of the facilities by depository institutions is by and large determined by economic and financial market conditions; that is, while financial markets are under strain, depository institutions will continue to borrow and other institutions will continue to borrow, and when things get better, they’ll borrow less.  We’ve thought of that aspect of it as being roughly independent, and, for most cases, that seems to be borne out by the anecdotal information we get from markets. The particular institution you’re talking about, I agree, is quite different from a lot of the other institutions.  That bank has a very large amount of reserve balances that it owns outright in some sense.  In addition, it’s also borrowing a reasonably large amount from the Federal Reserve.  To me, that says that it’s choosing, as I think you characterized it accurately, its level  of reserve balances as a specific target—this is how much it wants to hold, and it has some latitude to go up or down. Our reading on the rest of the banking system—the banking system in the aggregate—is not quite that way.  The bulk of the activity in lending facilities involves not depository institutions but other institutions.  Their borrowing through the commercial paper funding facility, for example, shows up as a quantity of reserve balances, but it’s not a depository institution that has done that borrowing.  If we wanted to get that set of reserve balances out of the banking system, there’s not a bank that would intentionally repay that borrowing to reduce their reserve holdings—it’s the CP issuer that’s doing it.  So, in that sense, we’ve separated most of the borrowing as a response to financial market conditions and economic conditions in  constructing the reserve balances. \n",

Well, the convexity hedging phenomenon, particularly in the current episode, was actually more concentrated in servicers and not so much in MBS investors themselves, although I’m sure there were a few of those that were selling convexity.  Servicing portfolios have even more convexity than mortgages, so, dollar for dollar, it doesn’t take a big change in their duration to cause someone who is hedging to sell either a lot of swaps or a lot of Treasuries.

Over the past decade or so, it’s been something like 40 weeks per year that at least one Reserve Bank hasn’t made a remittance to the Treasury.  So  it’s not as though this is something that is completely unprecedented for the Federal Reserve.  What would be very different here is that it would happen for the Federal Reserve System as a whole.   \n",

      "MR. CARPENTER.  It has been the stated policy that it’s expected that these assets will be managed through time to recover everything, so in that sense the official view is that there will be no losses.  Given that, the estimate is conservative—it’s taking on more losses than was  originally expected by the policy itself. The other part that’s not obvious to me is the effect if, for example, interest rates rose.  If that increasing rate was because the economy as a whole was getting better and financial markets were healing and everyone thought the outlook was very, very rosy, then the underlying value of some of those assets may no longer be distressed.  Some of the write-downs are because of the strains in financial markets.  You could imagine cases where some of those assets increase in value because the economy is turning around and the outlook is brighter, and it’s exactly those sorts of multivalent influences that caused us to throw up our hands somewhat and take the coward’s way out. \n",

If you don’t get to $200 billion, you lessen the problem, but I think we would pursue the authority to lend our agency holdings regardless of whether we thought the program was going to end before $200 billion or get all the way to $200 billion.  We’re already seeing these strains.  We think making these holdings available to the market makes sense in terms of supporting posing little risk to the Federal Reserve. \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  The other point is on the interest on excess reserves.  It’s certainly true  that there’s a possibility that as the markets and the economy begin to recover, we’ll have a lot of excess reserves sitting out there.  And the opportunity cost to banks may be, “Okay, when can I make a good business loan at 8 percent or 7 percent?”  And they view the risk tradeoffs for that as the right ones.  We may be faced with a situation, even if we thought interest on excess reserves worked perfectly, where we would have to raise the IOER very aggressively to choke off that massive amount of liquidity that may be just sort of running out into the marketplace.  If interest on excess reserves isn’t working as we’d like to see it work, then we are going to have to combine that with some other mechanism for draining those excess reserves.  The question is: What’s the relevant interest rate that’s going to guide us in some of those moves?  And I think that’s very difficult to sort out, even with the tremendous job the staff has done—there’s a lot of forest and a lot of weeds here in trying to sort through the details.  But I do think it’s important that we try to make sure that if Plan A doesn’t work, we have a Plan B.  That is, we need to make sure that if IOER doesn’t work as we hoped it would, we have other mechanisms to drain the reserves.  But we may have to do that at a very rapid pace, which may mean some of these mechanisms that you suggest may operate more quickly and are more easily implemented than others, and that might be a consideration that we have to think about. \n",

      "MR. WARSH.  Mr. Chairman, let me try to be brief but address a couple of the topics that were raised in the so-called question part of the discussion.  And then I’ll try to go through the topics that you mentioned briefly. First, the remittance discussion, where I think we put that in legal terms—Seth was asked for decided legal judgments—and we put it in political terms.  I think most of the remittance discussion actually is about credibility.  In the event bad things happen and we end up with losses that are enduring, what does that do to the credibility of Fed actions?  The Fed’s ability to affect these markets typically comes not because of the size of the actions, but because of who is taking them.  So I think that credibility could suffer in those circumstances, and I’ll try to use  that credibility idea to consider whether we are crowding in other investors to these markets or crowding out other investors for the balance of my discussion on your third point on asset  purchases. The Desk asked for our views on several topics.  First, on the policy objectives of the asset purchases, I think markets have heard us say different things about what our objective function is.  Mine would be to improve market functioning, to bring liquidity to markets that are not trading, to narrow bid–asked spreads, and the like.  This would suggest having the Desk devote its resources to securities, such as off-the-run securities, that are less liquid.  I think levels across Treasuries or MBS.  I think we have rightly steered away from it.  But they think that we are still cognizant of prices at some level and that we are trying to move rates lower.  So the first question the Desk asked is:  Could we collectively be clear on an objective function?  I think we could, and I would suggest that your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and Monetary Policy Report might be the best means of doing so.  72 of 261\f",
      "The second question raised by the Desk was about expanding asset purchases.  I’m  exceptionally uncomfortable with expanding asset purchases, particularly now.  The Desk, I think, had a preference, understandably, for increasing Treasuries.  That doesn’t fit my preferred objective, which is that we’re entering markets to improve market functioning.  So, on that basis, I think that market was working well before we got in it, and I’d say it’s still working well.  But if we got into it in significant size, I could see it actually working less well.  Had risk-free rates fallen markedly since we started purchasing Treasuries, Mr. Chairman, I would have expected some to say:  “Well, then we should do more of it.”  But risk-free rates have increased since we started purchasing, yet I hear some say, “Well, we should do more of it.”  So I’m not sure what fact scenario would have suggested doing less of it, and it makes me a little uncomfortable.  I think Brian Sack did a great job of explaining how all-in costs of capital for real private companies in this market have come down, and meaningfully so.  I don’t think that has much, if anything, to do with our Treasury purchases.  It could have much to do with the suite of things that we’ve done in the last 20 months, but I think it gives too much credit to suggest that somehow that’s related to the purchases of Treasuries.  I don’t think that our science is so good that we know that increasing the size of our Treasury purchases to $450 billion, but not to $750 billion, would have a modest, marginally positive effect.  It’s not at all obvious to me where risk-free rates would be had we avoided buying Treasuries; they might have been higher or they might have been lower.  But I must say I’m not convinced, and as a result, not at all comfortable expanding further. In terms of the expanding purchases of agencies, I think the Desk rightly warns us that doing so could actually do some harm to that market.  Given how big we are to the new issuance  73 of 261\f",
      "market when it wasn’t functioning, and we helped improve market functioning.  But to the extent that we’re 70 or 80 percent of certain classes of securities, I would say that that two-sided market is not forming well, and I would be very hesitant to go further there. The third question raised by the Desk:  What about flexibility between and among asset classes, that is, what if we just pool all of this stuff together and say we’re smart and we’re going to use the following criteria?  I think that would be read by markets to mean that we’re increasing potentially the purchases of Treasuries.  I think that would risk crowding out those investors who would think that there are strange things afoot, so I don’t think that’s a prudent idea.  In terms of flexibility within asset classes, I think markets have learned that we’re not as responsive to changes in rates as they would like, and my own sense would be it’s a noble goal to have flexibility, but flexibility in a vacuum will lead to continued ambiguity or accentuated ambiguity.  So I don’t think that that’s a great way forward. In terms of increasing flexibility to be more responsive to market rates, I just don’t think we should be fighting against the tape here.  I’m not sure we know what the real market-clearing rates are for some of these things.  In terms of securities lending, which I think has been much abused outside of the Federal Reserve and poorly understood by market participants, I share Brian’s view that our being in the securities lending business could actually be useful to solve what I would consider to be the preeminent policy objective of helping market functioning improve. So that’s just a quick list of some of the things that you asked us to address, Mr. Chairman.  On Brian Madigan’s modifications of various liquidity facilities, I think it is confidence-inducing, not risk-inducing, for the world to know that we are thinking about exits.  Even those market participants who think that the economy could well unwind again will believe  74 of 261\f",
      "that we can be more comfortable improvising in a forward-leaning way if we can at the same  time be thinking about how we get out of this when conditions warrant.  Without going into detail on Brian’s list, I think it’s constructive, and I think that the Thursday press release is likely to be in some ways more impactful to market’s understanding of our way forward than our FOMC statement on Wednesday.

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have a few quick comments.  I agree with all the points in the Madigan memo.  I think it does recognize what is happening with our liquidity facilities.  I have advocated before that we get them all priced as backstops and not that they actually need to be used at every point in time.  I would also announce a rescission date for GSE lending.  Couldn’t we make that February 1, 2010, as well?  That would push it off into the future and would line it up with the other dates as opposed to doing it immediately.  I would go ahead and raise the minimum bid rate.  I don’t feel strongly on that.  I guess I come out where Governor Kohn and President Fisher have.  My thinking on that was that we could encourage more-normal market functioning there.  Vice Chairman Dudley brings up a good point, namely, that it sounds like raising an interest rate.  I think that’s a communication issue, and that would have to be handled appropriately. On the issues related to exiting, my overall reading is that there are some very promising but unproven ideas here, mostly to do with interest on reserves and reverse repos.  We think they’ll work, but at this point they’re not really proven.  I guess I’m reluctant to go further with asset purchases without more concrete ideas on how we’ll manage this going forward, although I do admit that these are promising. The current policy response to the crisis has been to lower nominal interest rates to zero and more than double the monetary base.  I think this discussion indicates that that increase in  the monetary base will be very persistent, which is unprecedented in post-war U.S. history.  I am worried that we don’t really know what the implications of that might be, and we don’t really have tools in place to manage that.  So we’re not really exiting from that increase in the base, we’re just saying:  “That was our response.  We’re going to more than double the monetary base, and we’re going to see what happens.”  93 of 261\f",
      "On asset purchases strategy, I’d be fine with the tapering off.  I don’t feel really strongly on that.  I think if we stick with our dates, the exit might go fine on the Treasuries. In the current environment of large fiscal deficits, as several people have mentioned, including Governor Kohn, there’s always going to be talk about monetizing the debt.  I just don’t think we can get away from it in this environment.  Anything we do that smacks of buying up more Treasuries is going to be problematic.  So even though I have advocated in the past for treating MBS and Treasuries and debt all as one package and letting the Desk manage it, now I think it may not be the best thing to do. I’m also sympathetic with President Rosengren, who spoke earlier this afternoon about a state-contingent reaction function.  I have advocated for this before here, and though I know we are a long way from that, that’s really what you want.  You want to be able to communicate to the public that if the data come in a little bit worse, then we’re going to do a little bit more, and if  the data come in a little bit better, we’re going to do a little bit less.  That’s the kind of thing that you want.  You have that in something like a Taylor Rule for interest rate policy.  You’d like that for asset purchases.  We just haven’t been able to formulate something like that.  I’d like to encourage us to keep thinking in that direction.  After all, zero interest rates might go on for several years, so it’s not as if this situation is about to end.  So I think we should still keep thinking about that, but I know that we’re a long way from that at this point.  Thank you very much. \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Good morning.  Business conditions in the Third District remained relatively soft in May and early June.  Nevertheless, the steepness of the noticeably improved.  While our contacts don’t expect a strong upturn in business activity, they clearly see signs of stabilization in the near term. The most positive indicator from our Business Outlook Survey, which was released last week, is manufacturing, and that index said that general activity improved from a minus 22.6 in standards go.  This indicates essentially flat activity in the District now.  This is considerably stronger than some of the national industrial production numbers, but consistent with some of the other regional manufacturing surveys.  Our survey has a fairly long history—a little longer than Richmond’s, I believe, but I’m not sure.  [Laughter]  And a movement above zero in this index likely marks the recession’s trough, based on past relationships between this index and NBER recession dates.  The future activity index moved up quite sharply in June to levels we haven’t  seen in several years. The most negative factor in the District was the unemployment report.  The unemployment rate in our three states rose another 0.4 percentage point and now stands at 8.4 percent.  Payrolls have continued to fall, and, even in our surveys, the employment picture does not look terribly bright. Based primarily on the expected labor market data, I’ve revised downward slightly my near-term forecast for 2009 and upped my unemployment rate forecast compared with April.  But I have to confess that my forecast in April was on the outlier side of positive compared with many others.  The basic shape of my forecast, however, remains very similar:  A return to  118 of 261\f",
      "positive economic growth in the second half of this year and recovery gaining traction in 2010, picking up to about 3 percent.  This is actually similar to the Greenbook’s forecast, which has been revised up since our last meeting, so maybe we are converging here at some point.  However, our inflation forecast continued to differ.  I see less deflationary pressures than the Greenbook baseline, and, even with its upward revision to inflation, I see greater risk of higher inflation not in the near term, but in the outyears. I continue to be skeptical of putting too much weight on output gaps as predictors of inflation.  My reading of the literature suggests that gaps are difficult to measure with any precision, and this may be one reason that gap measures get little weight in empirical estimations of New Keynesian Phillips curve models.  From the staff discussion yesterday on the range of  gap measures, it appears we may have very different perceptions about how to go about constructing the appropriate measure of potential output.  Nevertheless, I think it was interesting.  In fact, the estimates reported yesterday showed a very wide range of views of what the output gap may be—from something like minus 7 or 8 percent to minus 2 or 3 percent.  We view that as being a range of uncertainty about the magnitude of the gap.  In a simple Phillips curve model, that may imply a difference of between 200 and 300 basis points in what a Taylor rule might imply about the fed funds rate.  That’s a pretty large difference in policy stance, so that may suggest very different policies. If we are closer to the smaller measure of the output gap than to the larger measure, it also means that we may have to raise rates sooner than we might think.  In Philadelphia’s own DSGE forecasting model, we actually get considerably higher inflation pressures going forward than the Greenbook baseline shows, particularly if the fed funds rate stays at zero through 2012.  Given the difficulties in estimating and forecasting inflation, I do think we need to consider  119 of 261\f",
      "alternative forecasts seriously.  With the aggressive monetary policy actions we have taken, I think this means looking at the possibility that our own inflation forecast possesses clear risks to the upside and preparing ourselves and the public for the possibility that we may have to act sooner rather than later.  In addition, the size of our balance sheet might complicate our ability to respond as rapidly as necessary to curtail inflation pressures.  And while inflation expectations have so far remained anchored, I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that this might change if agents become convinced that projected fiscal deficits will be monetized or if we fail to act in a timely manner.  For these reasons, I think we should be very cautious of being overly confident that we can leave monetary policy accommodation in place as long as the Greenbook suggests without some very bad consequences on the inflation front. Needless to say, with that perspective in mind, the fed funds rate path embedded in my forecast is considerably steeper than the Greenbook’s, which holds rates at zero through 2011.  I believe we will need to begin raising rates by early next year at the latest and throughout the forecast horizon, to at least 3½ or 4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011.  I don’t believe we can keep the fed funds rate at zero and expect to achieve anything close to our inflation objective or maintain our credibility in achieving that objective over the longer run.  We can say what we please, but it cannot substitute for action.  Our assessment of the output gap will be central to how the Committee thinks about the appropriate time to change course and begin to tighten, and we may have to do so in a fairly rapid way.  If we dramatically overestimate the size and  persistence of the output gap and wait, we will be too late to stem significant inflation risk.  I think we also will need to monitor carefully quantities of various kinds, whether it be bank lending or other measures.  In the past, our operating procedures have constrained reserves deliberately through our control of the fed funds rate and through limiting reserves to the  120 of 261\f",
      "marketplace.  Now those reserves are already out there, in the form of excess reserves in the  banking system.  When banks decide it’s time to start lending again, those reserves can move  from excess reserves into bank lending very quickly, and they will not need to be supplied by us as in the old operating regime.  Therefore, I think this transition might be very quick—I don’t mean days, but certainly over a series of months.  Depending on what we view as the appropriate equilibrium interest rate, our setting for the fed funds rate or the IOER may have to move up quite rapidly, because the opportunity cost of funds in terms of bank lending may move up fairly rapidly in the process. I think we’re going to face some severe challenges at the turning point when we have to make the decision to move.  It may come sooner than we think, and it may have to be more rapid than we think.  I think we have to prepare ourselves for that possibility, and through our communications, prepare the public for that eventuality as well.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay, let’s recommence.  I have a summary, which I will read to you.  Most participants saw a slowing contraction and tentative signs of stabilization in economic activity.  Business and household confidence has improved some, and surveys show improved expectations for the future.  Inventory liquidation continues, which is a positive for growth later this year, and financial markets have continued to improve.  Despite this relatively good news, though, most saw the economy as still quite weak and fragile and vulnerable to new shocks.  Labor markets are extremely soft, and financial markets may be ahead of themselves.  While output should begin to grow again, the pace is likely to be quite slow and tentative.  Although downside risks have been mitigated somewhat, they still exist.  Likewise, recovery abroad seems likely to be uneven and gradual, with Europe still facing financial problems and East Asia still too reliant on exports. Consumer spending, though no longer declining, is not robust either, reflecting the weak labor market, sharp wealth reductions, and higher oil prices.  Real income growth is likely to slow for the remainder of the year.  Consumers continue to focus on necessities and appear liquidity constrained.  Housing has shown a few signs of life but is vulnerable to the effects of the rising mortgage rates and continuing high rates of foreclosure.  Capital investment remains very soft, reflecting unused capacity and uncertainty about the economy and about the policy environment.  Across industries, weakness is widespread and includes service industries, although some areas, such as energy and agriculture, are doing better.   Labor markets remain a particular area of concern.  Despite some improvement in new and continuing UI claims, and a less bad payroll report for May, the unemployment rate and the rate of job loss remained high, with little near-term prospect for improvement.  Workweeks are shorter.  Total hours of work have fallen significantly.  More layoffs are permanent, and the  160 of 261\f",
      "amount of involuntary part-time work is high.  I should add that participation rates have risen also because of wealth effects.  Slow wage growth is reflecting this weakness.  The NAIRU may have risen somewhat, but a significant unemployment gap still probably exists.  Financial markets continue to show improvement.  The banking stress tests were perceived to be successful and resulted in capital raises and improved funding conditions.  Loan volumes are not falling especially dramatically, but in part this reflects government support, which may be withdrawn.  Reduced lending and tighter terms also reflect worsening credit quality, and banks still face substantial credit losses in coming quarters.  Other credit markets also continue to improve, including the corporate market and the ABS market.  The financing of commercial real estate remains problematic, however, and fundamentals for the sector are weakening.  Improvements in financial markets support the stabilization of the broader economy but could prove fleeting if the projected strengthening in growth and profits does not materialize. Higher oil and commodity prices will raise headline inflation in the near term, while core inflation seems likely to be low.  As noted, wages continue to remain nearly flat, and productivity has been surprisingly high, so that the growth in unit labor costs is moderate.  Overall, inflation seems likely to be well controlled in the near term, and most see deflation risks as now relatively small.  Some were concerned about inflation expectations in the medium term.  As measured by TIPS breakevens and by most household and business surveys, inflation expectations seem to be stable at reasonable levels.  However, publicity about fiscal deficits and the Fed’s balance sheet has concerned many in the public and may be reflected in inflation risk premiums and longer-term interest rates.  Communication about the exit strategy and the Fed’s commitment to price stability is an important tool for managing expectations.  At the same time,  161 of 261\f",
      "some suggest that it is important not to signal that the unwinding of the Fed’s extraordinary measures is imminent.   around the table today. That’s my summary of what I heard, which I do think was a fairly consistent message Let me just add a few thoughts, which will not be particularly novel, given all that has been said.  First, I think one can’t help but be at least somewhat encouraged by the developments in financial markets since our last meeting.  The Federal Reserve staff and leadership, I think, deserve some credit for the assessment of the banking system, and the results that that had.  It’s very encouraging that banks can raise equity and that their funding has improved—CDS spreads have declined.  I think that, although systemic risk is still around, it is much less now than it was a few months ago, and the reduced probability of a major calamity in the financial system is, in itself, I think, a positive.  We’ve also seen improvements, as I mentioned, in other credit markets as well, partly because of government support, including Fed programs.  Obviously, an important development in the financial markets in the intermeeting period was the increase in long-term interest rates.  Yesterday when the staff showed the changes in government rates across a number of industrial countries, I thought it was interesting that the increase in the U.K. rate was about the same as the increase in the German rate, both of which  were much less than the U.S. rate.  Since the U.K. is viewed as having many of the same problems in terms of fiscal sustainability and the balance sheet that we have, the fact that those rates had risen no more than rates in Germany suggests to me that a lot of what’s happening in the U.S. is the result of a stronger outlook and a reversal of the flight-to-quality flows, which in itself is, I think, encouraging.  162 of 261\f",
      "So, again, I think one of the better developments of the intermeeting period is the broad-based improvement in financial markets.  Having said that, as someone already mentioned, we’ve been head-faked on this before.  I recall October 2007 when our statement essentially expecting growth and recovery, and then we got hit with calamities in September and October.  So I do think we need to be very cautious and recognize that the financial improvements are, in some sense, discounting progress that is expected in the future.  And until we see concrete evidence of that progress, we shouldn’t overreact to the financial improvements. As many people have noted, the explicit evidence even for stabilization, much less for recovery, is not really at hand yet.  For example, consumption growth in the second quarter is still likely to have been negative, and there are a number of drags that continue to be an issue there.  In the labor markets, many have noted very severe conditions.  Although UI claims have come down a bit, they’re still at extraordinarily high levels, and we would expect to see continuing job losses for some time.  In housing, mortgage rates and foreclosures are going to be a drag on the very tentative improvement.  I think my message is that we should be encouraged by the financial improvements but note that they are very contingent.  They depend on the realization of actual improvement in the economy.  We have seen some stabilization, but the evidence of solid stabilization or the beginnings of growth is certainly not here yet, and we should not overestimate that evidence.  It’s also important to keep in mind that, although we’re accustomed to thinking about the stages of the cycle and to think about growth rates, the amplitude of the shock was extraordinarily large.  So we are very far away by any measure, I think, from normalcy.  Even if the economy does begin to grow at a slow pace, we’ll be very far from full employment for some time, which has  163 of 261\f",
      "implications.  The longer you’re away from full employment, the worse credit losses will be, the worse hysteresis will be in the labor market, the worse income effects will be on consumers, and so on.  So the size of the decline also will have effects that could lead to a longer persistence as well.  So, again, I think we should be somewhat cautious about declaring victory. Inflation—I heard both sides of this argument.  I guess the standard view would be that core inflation, at least, is likely to continue to moderate.  There were a number of special factors besides the tobacco taxes.  There were some unusual aspects of the change in model year for automobiles, which probably raised inflation in the last few months.  So I would expect that to be relatively soft.  It’s consistent with very slow growth in nominal wages.  Also, there’s productivity growth, which keeps unit labor costs under control. Inflation expectations are a somewhat different matter, as others have mentioned.  What has happened so far—namely, that inflation has come back up to more normal levels—I take as a success, not a problem.  Deflation risks were a concern.  Within reason, an increase in inflation expectations reduces real interest rates and reduces debt burdens and is actually positive.  Of course, as many people have noted, we don’t want too much of a good thing—we don’t want to go further.  Higher inflation rates, besides being a problem for price stability, probably have negative effects on growth as well.  For example, higher nominal mortgage rates tend to raise nominal payments, which could have effects on the demand for housing.  So I agree with President Plosser and others that we do have to pay very close attention to inflation expectations and that our communication will be very important.  In that respect, I think that the careful description of our exit strategy in the Monetary Policy Report and the Humphrey-Hawkins will be important.  And all of us should continue to emphasize our ability to withdraw the stimulus  164 of 261\f",

One is that, of course, credit intermediation through the banking sector seemingly remains still quite impaired, judging by actual credit flows and by responses to things like the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Also, as Brian mentioned in his briefing, there’s still a tremendous range of support that’s being provided to financial markets and institutions.

      "MR. SACK.  To my knowledge, we did not try the level of yields, and of course, chart 3 shows the outcome of just one model.  But I think the argument that ARMs look expensive to households seems pretty compelling.  I mean, you do not need a regression to tell you that; you can pretty much see it in chart 24.  Even if activity tends to fall off when rates are low, we have to at least entertain the idea that the apparent expense of ARMs—the wide spread that we see today—is contributing to that falloff.  So it’s possible that the purchase program would bring the ARM spread in and make it more comparable with the fixed-rate spread but still households would choose fixed-rate mortgages because those rates are very low.  I think that’s possible, and that’s fine.  I think one would argue, well, let’s bring that spread down and then let households make that choice.  So in no way are we suggesting that you target some proportion of ARM issuance or push on this until you get ARM issuance back up.  We are just saying that, you could argue, Let’s bring down what looks to be a very wide yield spread, and let households make that  choice. \n",

      "MR. SLIFMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If I may paraphrase Garrison Keillor, it’s been a relatively quiet few weeks for macro forecasters.  For the most part, the high-frequency data on activity that we have received since the June FOMC meeting have come in either in line with our expectations or a bit better, and the numbers continue to remain consistent with the hypothesis that economic activity is stabilizing.  At the same time, as Brian has already described, financial conditions have continued to improve.  Before I discuss some of the details of the forecast, let me briefly cover two other matters:  last Friday’s labor market report and the comprehensive revision to the national income and product accounts.  First, regarding the labor market, the BLS reported that private nonfarm payroll employment fell 254,000 in July, and the previously thought.  The net result is that the level of private employment in July was about 85,000 higher than we were expecting when we published the Greenbook.  In addition, the unemployment rate ticked down to 9.4 percent—we had been expecting a small increase.  Although we would not be inclined to make any changes to our GDP projection as a result of this more favorable labor market news, it does help reinforce our view that a gradual turnaround in economic activity will begin in the second half of the year.  As regards the NIPA revision, I would emphasize two elements.  First, as you know, real GDP was revised down considerably in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.  This downward revision reduced some of the tension between our estimates of the output gap and the unemployment rate gap but did not eliminate it.  During the next several weeks, we plan to reassess all of our supply-side estimates, but at this point we don’t anticipate any major changes.  The second important element of the NIPA revision was a sequence of sizable downward revisions to real disposable personal income beginning in early 2007.  The cumulative effect of the revisions was to put DPI on a significantly weaker trajectory through the middle of 2009, which was an important ingredient in our thinking about the outlook for consumer spending.  One other data revision, which we learned with the release of the June figures for personal income and outlays, was a downward revision to personal consumption expenditures in the first half of 2009.  Prior to the revision, it appeared that consumer spending was edging higher during the first half of the year.  However, the new data, instead, now show consumption to have been drifting down over much of the period.  Nevertheless, we still expect a gradual turnaround in consumer spending in the second half of the year—based in part on a further boost from fiscal stimulus as well as less-pronounced employment declines and improving financial conditions.    Outside the consumer sector, the latest readings on housing starts and orders for capital goods point to a lessening in the declines for residential construction and equipment spending.  Moreover, with final demand stabilizing and inventory positions considerably improved from earlier in the year, we think that over the next several months firms will slowly begin to move production back up toward the level 50 of 165\f",
      "of sales.  Indeed, a number of indicators of near-term movements in factory output— such as weekly steel production, durable goods orders, and various business surveys—suggest that such an adjustment may already be in process.  For next year, we continue to expect the growth rate of real GDP to pick up.  Importantly, continued financial healing, supported by accommodative monetary policy, sets the stage for further improvements in household and business sentiment and an acceleration in final demand.  All told, real GDP is projected to rise about 3 percent over the four quarters of 2010, close to the projection in the June Greenbook.  Nevertheless, the rate of increase in GDP next year—while still faster than the rise in potential—is relatively tepid for an economic recovery, only enough to reduce the unemployment rate to 9½ percent.    Our forecast reflects a balancing of a number of forces.  A negative factor was the lower trajectory for disposable income that I previously mentioned; given the typical lags between income and spending, this acts as a drag on consumption in coming quarters.  On the plus side of the ledger, as Brian noted earlier, equity prices are up appreciably since the last Greenbook, whereas corporate bond yields and spreads are down.  In addition, as Nathan will discuss, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is down, and the forecast for foreign growth is stronger.   As for the components of real GDP next year, the basic stories haven’t changed in any important ways.  In the household sector, we expect consumer spending to strengthen and the saving rate to drift down a bit as prospects for jobs and incomes brighten, negative wealth effects wane, and the availability of consumer credit improves.  Meanwhile, housing demand and construction, which appear to have reached their bottoms this summer, are expected to strengthen as income picks up and low mortgage rates and lower real estate prices enhance affordability.  In the business sector, we think that the usual accelerator mechanism should spur outlays for equipment and software, augmented by some easing of financial constraints and by some extra demand as a result of replacement spending that had been deferred during the recession.  In contrast, business outlays for structures such as office and commercial buildings are expected to continue to contract throughout 2010 in the presence of extremely tight credit conditions and falling property values.  Turning to the outlook for inflation, the NIPA revision incorporated new information on nonmarket prices, which now show a sharp deceleration in the first half of the year.  But we don’t take any signal from this; and when all is said and done, it looks as though the underlying pace of core inflation has been running a little higher than we had anticipated.  In addition, survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.  In contrast, the incoming data on hourly compensation have decelerated sharply this year.  The employment cost index increased at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in the first half of 2009, whereas the Labor Department reported this morning that the productivity and cost measure of hourly compensation declined at a rate of about 1 percent.  These low readings suggest that economic slack already is weighing heavily on labor costs.  We continue 51 of 165\f",
      "to expect that the low level of resource utilization will hold down price inflation as well over the projection period, with core PCE prices rising about 1½ percent this year and 1 percent next year.   In the Greenbook, we highlighted several risks to our output and inflation forecasts.  On the downside for output, we noted the possibility that the improvement in financial conditions observed since the spring could prove to be short-lived and the financial system could suffer a relapse rather than recuperate.  We also highlighted the possibility that, in the wake of the financial and economic turmoil of the past two years, households could raise by a significant amount their desired saving relative to the baseline.  According to the policy rule we use, either outcome would noticeably delay the eventual liftoff of the funds rate from the zero lower bound.  That said, we also recognize the possibility that financial healing could occur more rapidly than we anticipate.  Such a development would lead to a more robust recovery of economic activity and less unemployment.  Under those circumstances, the federal funds rate lifts off from zero a year earlier than in the baseline.  The funds rate also would be expected to lift off sooner under our assumed policy rule if the inflation outlook were to take a decisive turn upward.  This might occur, for example, if the public’s concerns about the expansion of our balance sheet were to manifest themselves in an appreciable increase in inflation expectations.  We examined this possibility in an alternative Greenbook scenario in which we assumed that long-run inflation expectations rise about 1 percentage point over the next several months.  In that scenario, core PCE inflation climbs steadily over the projection period, reaching 2½ percent by 2013. That development in turn brings forward the liftoff in the federal funds rate by three quarters.  So, what does this all mean?  Well, while it’s been a quiet few weeks for macro forecasters, the risks to the economic outlook are still all above average.  Nathan will now continue our presentation.  \n",

      "MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Having exhausted my limited stock of witticisms about coming last in line before the Chairman, I asked Debbie to move me up.  [Laughter]  But I also wanted to come a little earlier because, even in the five months since my  first FOMC meeting, a lot has changed.  At that time, we were contemplating essentially two scenarios, very bad and even worse.  In no small part because of the various actions of the Federal Reserve, the financial system and the economy have largely stabilized, albeit at historically lower levels than we would certainly like to see. It seems very likely now there will be positive, perhaps quite positive, growth in the second half of this year.  As for 2010, more upside risk has crept into many people’s forecasts.  So in thinking about our policies going forward, we may be at a point at which it is useful to consider alternative outcomes in a roughly probabilistic fashion and to test how readily we can craft the narrative that leads to each outcome.  It would be a bit quixotic of me to undertake this task for all seven of the Greenbook scenarios to which Larry alluded earlier, so let me distill the manifold possibilities to just three.  One, grind it out—a gradual, somewhat halting recovery that leads to 2010 growth somewhere in the vicinity of trend but below what one might expect in a rebound from a severe slump.  Two, relapse—a significant stumble for the recovery next year, with GDP growth again dropping significantly below trend.  And, three, rejuvenation—a much more robust recovery, with GDP growth significantly exceeding trend, not quite a V-shape perhaps but a reasonably steep slope on the way up. So just to put my cards on the table, I would assign roughly even odds to the first possible outcome, the grind-out scenario.  Not coincidentally, I regard the Greenbook extended baseline to be consistent with this outcome.  Although I am somewhat less optimistic about next year than the staff is, I note that their forecast for the second half of this year is pretty conservative.  So if  66 of 165\f",
      "one averages out their forecast over six quarters, it yields something akin to the first outcome.  Of the remaining two, I see a somewhat greater chance of relapse than of rejuvenation, though I should say that I now regard the odds of the two alternative outcomes as considerably less skewed than I thought as recently as the June meeting.  So clearly I find the story of measured recovery the easiest to tell, in part because the very factors that augur well for the remainder of 2009 may not have sufficient staying power to maintain a healthy pace of recovery through all of next year.  The salutary effects of the fiscal stimulus package will start tapering off in the first part of next year.  The undoubted need for firms to replenish their inventories will lead to sustained production increases only if consumption increases can themselves be generated and maintained.  The case for a steady increase in personal consumption expenditures is certainly plausible, but it is hardly compelling.  According to the reported employment cost index, private wages and salaries have been decelerating.  With large and still growing slack in labor markets, there is good reason to believe that personal income will continue to suffer from rising unemployment and suppressed wage gains.  Moreover, there remains, as Larry mentioned, the important question of what saving rate we will see once incomes do begin to rise again.  The Greenbook makes a reasonable case based on past experience for a 4 percent rate, but the present crisis may contain the seeds of a behavioral shift among some classes of consumers that could move the rate  up a percentage point or more.  It appears that even the new normalcy in credit availability, both retail and wholesale, term funding markets and plain vanilla securitization markets, has not extended to credit markets more generally.  In particular, the rate of decline in bank lending has been accelerating during the 67 of 165\f",
      "spring and summer.  There will doubtless be multiple revisions to the July figures, but the preliminary estimate of a whopping 18 percent decline spread across all forms of lending is a sobering reminder of the difficulties ahead.  While a considerable part of this drop is surely attributable to the decline in demand and cautiousness in underwriting that are typical of recessions, it seems likely that there are also structural factors in both bank lending and credit  I can certainly tell the other two stories—though with less conviction and, in the interest of time, more briefly.  A relapse could occur if privately generated demand cannot adequately fill in behind the waning effect of fiscal stimulus, given such factors as the expected persistently high levels of unemployment; the potential for more-rapid efforts to repair personal, corporate, and financial balance sheets; and the severe retrenchment of sub-federal government spending that is coming in the next two budget cycles.  If commercial real estate markets turn out to be  even moderately worse than currently expected—bad enough—loan losses at many regional and community banks could become truly debilitating.   Rejuvenation might come if both confidence and wealth are significantly boosted by a continuation of the equity market rally and a more rapid recovery of housing markets.  The latter of course would also prompt a greater rebound in construction.  Along with the effects of pent-up consumer demand for durables and other items, these developments could provide not just a substitute for fiscal stimulus but a boost beyond the temporary effects of cash-for-clunkers, infrastructure investment, and the various income transfer features of the February legislative  package.  Global economic recovery, particularly in Asia, may proceed more quickly with an attendant boost to U.S. export growth.  While I can sketch out this more optimistic path, each of 68 of 165\f",
      "its elements seems quite a bit less likely than those supporting the more sluggish outcome and modestly less likely than the catalyst for relapse.  I will be interested to hear if some of you can tell this last tale more convincingly.  For the present, though, what I think is most important in my little exercise is that the chances of next year being somewhere between tepid and bad appear to me somewhere north of 75 percent in the absence of further monetary or fiscal policy measures.  Where exactly along that spectrum the actual outcome falls will probably not become much clearer for some time.  If this is a reasonable way of looking at things, our best-advised posture for at least a few more, and maybe more than a few more, meetings may be the somewhat unsatisfactory and awkward one of neither lifting another implement out of our toolbox nor closing the box up and declaring the job finished.

      "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like I think most people around the table, I am pretty confident that real GDP growth will be positive this quarter.  Much of the economic news has been better since the last meeting, with a wide range of indicators suggesting that the recession is either over or will be over very soon.  For the remainder of the year, the economy should be boosted by three factors that a lot of people have cited around the table—recovery in housing and a significant rise in motor vehicle sales, the effect of the fiscal stimulus program in supporting domestic demand, and a sharp swing in the pace of inventory investment.  In fact, if the inventory swing were concentrated in a particular quarter, we could actually see fairly rapid growth for a brief period.   But I expect that, as in the 2001–03 period, the recovery will be slower than usual, at least over the next year or two.  In particular, I expect that consumption is likely to grow only modestly.  First, growth of real disposable income will probably be weak by historical standards.  As I noted at the last meeting, there are a number of special factors that boosted real disposable income in the first half of the year, helping to offset a sharp drop in hours worked and very sluggish hourly wage gains.  These special factors will be absent during the second half of the year.  Second, households are still adjusting to the sharp drop in net worth caused by what will likely be a persistent decline in home prices and last year’s fall in equity prices.  This suggests to me that the desired saving rate will not decline sharply as the recession comes to an end.  As a consequence, consumer spending is unlikely to rise much faster than income.  In other words, weak income growth will act as an effective constraint on the pace of consumer spending.  Third, the financial system is still in the middle of a prolonged adjustment process.  Banks and other financial institutions are working their way through large credit losses, and the securitization 95 of 165\f",
      "markets are recovering only very slowly.  This means that credit availability will be constrained for some time to come, and this will also serve to limit the pace of the recovery.  Despite the big buildup of slack in the economy, the core measures of inflation have been somewhat sticky.  I don’t think this will last.  Thus, I think the risks on inflation are still likely to be on the downside over the next year or two.  There are two reasons why I think core inflation is likely to decline going forward.  First, the variables that respond to labor market slack, such as the employment cost index, have already fallen quite sharply.  This suggests that the output gap is exerting downward pressure on labor costs, which is a key component of overall costs in many industries.  Second, during the first half of the year, core services inflation has been lower than core goods inflation.  I think this is meaningful because core services inflation exhibits much more inertia than core goods inflation and because it is unusual for inflation for core services to be running lower than core goods inflation in the first place.  I don’t expect that we will see this pattern persist for long, and I suspect that it is more likely that core goods inflation will moderate than that core services inflation will pick up in the near term.  So I would expect the overall core inflation rate to come down.  Thank you. \n",

      "MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am going to echo and maybe expand upon some  of Governor Kohn’s comments about credit.  First of all, the current situation:  In the overall lending environment, demand is extremely low, although bankers are very happy with the quality and the spreads on the new credit that they are originating and they continue to shift resources to work through problem credits.  In C&I lending, credit quality is actually holding up better than they expected, but line utilization is at very low rates, in some cases 30 percent, maybe 50 percent on the high side, and again, new demand is weak.  In consumer credit, they did cite early-stage delinquencies as being improved, but nobody seemed particularly comfortable with calling that a trend. In residential real estate, the low-end product is beginning to move.  Sellers are lowering their price expectations, in some cases being forced by the banks that will no longer extend interest carry to get through this, and the buyers seems to be less fearful of further price declines.  Most of the buyers are either first-time homebuyers or investors who now see that the rental cash flow on these makes sense.  The inventory is actually fairly tight in the 3-to-6-months’ supply for the low  end and in the 30-to-40-months’ supply for the higher, larger properties.  Some of the inventory is just plain bad product.  It is bad construction; it is poor design, poor location, or too big.  The new  construction is generally smaller with fewer extras but still with quality finishes because that is what is being demanded at the moment. On the commercial real estate side, they are working down construction loans—some  through payout, some through charge-off, some through sales, and much through mini perm financing.  There is very little demand for new CRE (commercial real estate loans)—a reminder that commercial real estate loans are still just business loans and their performance is dependent upon the industry and the local economic conditions.

Retail is still suffering from rent renegotiation and vacancy rates, with rural areas and small towns being hit particularly  hard by big box closures.  Office and multifamily properties are weak but are still holding up reasonably well. When I look at credit availability, I am struck by the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey results, particularly the part that shows reductions in the number of respondents that have tightened terms while, when weighted by balances outstanding, more than 75 percent of the respondents expect the standards for prime borrowers to remain tighter than normal for the foreseeable future and the fraction for tighter terms for the foreseeable future for subprime is even higher.  In addition to having tighter terms for approval, banks are unlikely to engage in the aggressive acquisition strategies that they had—from the credit card mailings, the teaser rates, and that sort of thing— because of the inability to reprice post-acquisition.  Those are unlikely to resume, and I did hear reports of 40 percent to completely eliminating those types of promotions. On mortgage and home equity, as the indirect channels have performed so poorly, again, they are unlikely to resume indirect acquisition.  The existing credit card and home equity line availability is still being reduced.  I heard a lot about the credit card regulations, and my sense is that they are going to affect availability, pricing, and terms for maybe a couple of years but ultimately a new equilibrium will be found and a new business model will take hold.  Most actually expect C&I lending to return with improving business performance as banks look for income.  This is the place to which they all seem to be looking for additional income, but this may not translate into improved availability for small businesses.  Charge-offs are running very high on small business credit, and  small businesses are, frankly, very thinly capitalized.  Many of them are just giving up, no longer willing to advance the funds to keep the businesses running.  SBA eligibility is a very, very tiny 106 of 165\f",
      "slice of this market.  The majority of these loans are not even in C&I.  Some are in CRE—if you  think about hotels, gas stations, and that sort of thing, where the property is the business.  Some are in consumer, in mortgages, in home equity, and in credit cards.  Then I have a hard time even envisioning what the future of mortgage finance is going to look like.  The originate-to-distribute model is still broken, and there is no new model in sight.  The future of the GSEs is murky.  The FHA volume is growing amid rumors of credit problems and  potential fraud.  The private label is closed and unlikely to return without changes to originator compensation and examination, rating agencies, contracts with servicers, payment priorities, loss distribution and trust agreements, and transparencies of the loans underlying the securitizations.  So it is difficult to determine how dependent even the GSE market is on the Fed purchases. Finally, bankers are making loans regarding credit in light of a number of uncertainties in addition to uncertainties about economic outcomes.  The first one is capital requirements.  Will all banks be stress-tested?  Is that the new norm?  There is limited understanding of what the capital- assessment process is designed to do and what it might mean.  Community banks insist that 12 percent is the new 10 percent in terms of risk-based capital, and many note statements regarding higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions.   In terms of treatment on commercial real estate loans, while all of the anecdotes are  certainly not applicable to all banks and may not be applicable even to some banks, all banks  believe that they could be true.  They discuss the revival of the performing nonperformer.  I heard reports of the entire construction portfolio being classified.  If a property is not sold through two  sales cycles, although nobody seemed to know what that meant, it must be converted to a 10-year amortization.  Examiners are requiring new appraisals, and these are being affected by both reduced cash flow and higher cap rates and also by the fact that either there are no comparables or there are 107 of 165\f",
      "distress sales on the comparables.  The CRE loans are creating large classifications due to the reduced cash flows and lower appraisals, even if no loss is ultimately expected, followed by MOUs  and C&Ds if the classified loans are over 100 percent of capital, and then a requirement of dollar­ for-dollar capital for classified assets. Accounting issues are also of concern because they actually affect the measurement of capital.  FASB is getting ready to propose fair value accounting for all loans.  Securitizations,  participations, and loan sales are moving back on the balance sheet.  We found in the stress test the issues in understanding acquisition accounting and what that means for reserve measures, capital measures, and loan book measures, and then loan loss reserve accounting, consumer protection  rules, the credit card rules, the proposed CFPA, the proposal for plain vanilla products, the loss of preemption, and the prospect of a duty of care and fiduciary responsibility.  All of these are weighing on banks as they make their decisions.  Given all of these issues, I cannot take my eyes off the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook for financial fragility or higher saving rates and their unwelcome outcomes.

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we recommence?  We’ve had a number of  issues raised by the presentations.  First, there were some recommendations from the Desk on large-scale asset purchases, including possible tapering strategies.  Second, we had some discussion of reserve management tools and the progress there.  Third, there was a proposal essentially on the TAF and the TSLF.  Let me just mention parenthetically that, as I understand it from talking to Scott, no votes are needed to implement those proposals, because the TSLF directive in particular told the Desk to wind down the options as conditions permit.  I’d be happy to hear comments.  But if people would like to disagree with the press release or the plan, please say so.  If we get more or less consensus around the table, we won’t have to take a formal action on that, I think.  So those are three topics that we can talk about. This part of the meeting is billed on the agenda as an opportunity for informal, unstructured interaction [laughter], which I am going to duck, I think, in a minute.  I hope this is a chance for us just to have some interchange.  Let me just be very clear that we will not be making any decisions in this part of the meeting; the decisions on large-scale asset purchases, and so on, will be taken tomorrow in the policy round.  So please don’t feel that you are compelled to speak in order to get your voice heard—you will be heard.  But it would be useful,  I think, to have some additional discussion.  Before we get into that, I just wanted to say a word or two about the quantitative easing mechanism, because I feel as if there’s a certain amount of confusion going on.  So let me just say three straightforward things. The first point, and I think we all agree on this, is that any action we take—through purchases or auctions or whatever—to put reserves into the banking system, on net, will be expansionary, because whatever the banks do along the lines of what they told Bill English and 46 of 212\f",
      "his colleagues—whether it’s buying other assets, or lending, or whatever action they take—will  tend to be expansionary.  Of course, in equilibrium this will be reflected in lower short-term  interest rates across a range of potential assets.  And that’s essentially how quantitative easing works.  It’s meant to be expansionary, and I think it would be in the context that we’re using it here.  President Yellen made a good point during the break, which was that quantitative easing should be expansionary even if the leverage ratio were binding.  The reason is that, in order to avoid the leverage ratio, firms would either have to get rid of managed liabilities or lower deposit rates and otherwise prevent the inflow of cash into their institution.  If depositors are not incentivized to put money into banks, they will go to money market mutual funds or to other  types of short-term credit markets, and that, again, will have the effect of lowering short-term interest rates, and, therefore, be expansionary.  So I don’t think that there really is any barrier to quantitative easing being effective in our current institutional environment.   The second observation I would make is based on Bill’s simulations; based on what we know, we think the quantitative easing effects are probably pretty small.  Short-term interest rates are already low.  They might be made a little bit lower by quantitative easing, but I don’t see much chance of a huge overshoot in a short period of time.  I think that’s not what the evidence suggests.  It’s not what the Japanese experience suggests.  So quantitative easing should be expansionary, but I don’t see it as being a major part of our overall monetary policy stance. And then, the third thing I’d like to say is that we can exit from the high level of reserves.  We have, in fact, three methods to do that—we have two belts as well as a pair of suspenders.  First of all, we have the interest on reserves, which may be leaky, but certainly if it’s raised high enough it will tighten policy—there seems to be little doubt about that.  Second, we have the various ways of sterilizing reserves through reverse repos or time deposits.  I wasn’t quite clear 47 of 212\f",
      "about the timing, but my sense is that these things will be coming online by early next year.  So over the time frame in which we would have to do a significant amount of tightening, we should have the tools in place to do that.  Then, of course, the third method we know we can do is sell assets.  I think that that would not only have effects via the reversal of quantitative easing, but it also would have very powerful signaling and market effects.   These are very important issues for us to understand.  But I felt there was an impression somehow that we were not in control of the situation.  I don’t think that’s true.  Obviously, it’s a difficult and novel situation, but I do think that the staff and all of us working together have a pretty good understanding of how to manage this and how this relates to standard monetary policy. So that’s my little homily.  Let me now open up the floor for any comments on asset purchases, reserve management, TAF, TSLF, any of those things that anyone would like to bring up, and I would invite interaction.  Would anyone like to raise any points?  Ah, President Lacker, I knew I could count on you.  [Laughter] \n",

As financial markets have improved, I was wondering if I could get a handle on the degree to which financial headwinds affect this forecast compared with  the degree that you marked down your earlier forecasts when you also saw headwinds.  Has the picture changed for you in some way?  I’m not saying that headwinds have necessarily gone away, but have they changed given the evolution of the financial markets, and, if so, how?

      "MR. STOCKTON.  In terms of the productivity in the United States, we have been surprised in the first half of this year by its strength.  Our interpretation was largely that, as things started to collapse late last year, firms were a bit slow to cut payrolls.  Even though those cuts were huge, they were, in fact, fairly modest, relative to the size of the output declines, so we got a little cyclical downswing in productivity.  Since the first half of this year, firms have been exceedingly aggressive at cutting costs and extracting higher productivity gains.  In this forecast, we’re interpreting that as firms squeezing their work forces currently very hard and as being unlikely to let up quickly on that.  But we do think there’s going to be a gradual return.  Productivity is now probably above what we think the structural trend would be, and there will be some return to that structural trend slowly through a slowdown in the growth of productivity going forward.  Firms won’t be able to continue to extract the 4, 5, and 6 percent increases in productivity that they’ve gotten in recent quarters; it’s likely to slow down to more like 1½ percent. That’s an important risk in the outlook, because it’s clear that if, in fact, we were to have another year or two of gains in productivity that average close to 4 percent, we would be looking at something that looked more like a jobless recovery.  Even though GDP growth might look reasonably well sustained, it would be with less employment growth and a higher unemployment rate than is incorporated in the baseline forecast.  Why haven’t we put that into the baseline forecast?  At this point I think that’s a serious issue and one that we’re going to have to confront if, in fact, productivity stays as high as it has been recently.  I guess we’re just reluctant at this point to interpret what’s happened over the course of the past two years as a big, positive supply shock to the U.S. economy.  It’s possible there’s some sort of X-efficiency operating where businesses are under incredible pressure, and they’ll learn to do things differently, and they’ll 71 of 212\f",

We resisted marking down our potential output a whole lot when the crisis first began and people were talking about a big negative supply shock.  In retrospect, I think that still was a pretty good call, but we’re also reluctant to think that we’re going to get a big increase in sustained productivity growth going forward—but it’s possible.  And I think a jobless recovery that’s generated through both faster productivity and maybe somewhat longer work weeks for workers is a real risk to the outlook. \n",

      "MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For the first time in a long while, I have more conviction about what is going to happen in the next two or three quarters than I do over the next two or three years.  For the past couple of years, and especially last year, we wondered what was at our doorstep.  Now we can look to the medium-term forecast and say, “Well, this stuff will all work out.”  I would say in some ways this is as it should be.  Near-term prospects and projections should be clearer to policymakers, and I think for the first time, at least for me, they are. In terms of the trajectory of the economy, though, I would say I also feel better about the next few quarters than I do the next few years.  The reason for that improvement in conviction and in its strength on the real side of the economy has a lot to do with the asset price improvements and has considerably to do in addition, as Dave Stockton said yesterday, with inventories, as well as with the mix of fiscal and monetary measures, which are certainly helping the arithmetic of near-term GDP.  I think the Greenbook is right in suggesting—and not being as dismissive as many of us, myself included, would have been six or nine months ago—the chance  of a positive feedback loop that takes us out of where we are with greater strength and conviction.  Economies have been underestimated in the post–war era, and maybe we’re underestimating the resiliency of this one.  How durable is this improvement beyond the near term?  We’ve all heard stories.  I heard many of them from you yesterday about Fortune 500 CEOs.  If I go back to the 2001–2002 recession and recovery, these CEOs were lousy indicators about the turns in the economy.  So I guess I’m not that troubled that they continue to have their heads in their hands.  I think the difference this time, and the reason why this time they could be right, is that you’ve got to look  long and hard to find real anecdotes of small businesses that are seeing opportunities.  Given 113 of 212\f",
      "what Don talked about in terms of the bank lending, and the ability of small businesses to access credit, to access capital, and to get their own animal spirits back, it may be that businesses large and small are still suffering from a bit of pessimism, while we need them to be much more on their front foot. Another question about the durability of the improvement and whether it will find  medium-term forecasts as good as the Greenbook suggests is the state of private final demand in 2010.  It’s hard to know whether the handoffs from the public sector stimulus to the private sector improvements will happen as smoothly and in as linear a fashion as the Greenbook suggests.  Also, it’s hard to know whether recent improvements in industrial production are sustainable.   And on the consumer income issue that many people have talked about, the question is:  Will incomes be sufficient to fund consumption amid this specter of large unemployment?  Personally, I’m more worried about low income, excluding transfer payments, than I am low consumption per se.  And, if the unemployment levels stay as high as they are, will there be enough impetus in incomes, particularly if our asset prices smooth out over time, to fund the kind of consumption levels that are consistent with a reasonably positive Greenbook-type forecast? My medium-term forecast, as a result of all of that, is improved somewhat, but it’s not the downside.  The risk is that potential economic growth and employment may have faltered, making this recession in some sense more costly than the recent loss of jobs and output alone.  I think the continuing questions of the fiscal sustainability and markets’ acceptance of continuing  Treasury issuance are real risk factors to the medium-term forecasts. 114 of 212\f",
      "Let me turn, then, to financial markets before talking about inflation.  On the financial  and market functioning, as tactically long but strategically short.  What do I mean by that?   There’s still a ton of momentum in these markets.  As I said when we met last, about six weeks ago, though I was a skeptic about the degree of improvements in the spring and the summer, this thing has so much going for it in terms of momentum, in terms of money coming off the sidelines, in terms of institutional and retail investors who don’t want to miss the next leg, that it strikes me as imprudent, at least in the very near term, to try to stand in front of this wave and not get blown over.  Zero rates seem to be having some hand in driving this reflation in asset prices. But, why am I strategically short, or at least strategically nervous?  I worry about the sustainability of these improvements in markets, given the questions we’ve all talked about on the real side of the economy.  Many are saying, “Well, this time I will get out just in time,” and that reminds us of what we heard not too long ago.  Still, on net, consumer net worth has rallied with asset prices, and it is probably up another couple trillion dollars when we see the ultimate data from the third quarter, with the corresponding wealth and confidence effects. What are market price signals telling us?  Market prices might be as unclear as they’ve been in a very long time, even though on the real economy side we feel better.  It’s tougher to judge what these markets are telling us because of a few changes:  one, seeming changes in investor preferences and asset allocation; two, changes in the financial architecture, which I have talked about before; and, three, our extraordinary participation as the government in these participation, explicitly and implicitly, is hard to tell.  I think the Chairman mentioned yesterday 115 of 212\f",
      "this odd constellation of market signals since we last met as a Committee—stock prices are up, bond yields are down, Treasury yields are down, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is down, commodity prices are up.  That is hard for me to reconcile.  I could tell a long and twisted story, but it’s not a terribly convincing one, and it would certainly be nothing more than a rationalization. But let me start on the simplest pieces of it, and those are stocks and bonds.  Why are  they both performing as smartly?  I would say markets might be at a transitional point—some kind of barbell—and thinking about asset allocation.  They’ve seen equity markets move against them, they’re looking for alpha, they’re looking for returns, and so they’re going out and buying equities.  But just in case they’re wrong, they want to make sure that they hold on to enough cash—which is near and dear to their hearts—so that if the world were to somehow end again, they would have that.  Intermediate risks and intermediate credits seem to me to be looked upon somewhat more negatively by marginal investors. My last point on financial markets is on Treasury and Treasury market signals and what  they’re telling us.  They do seem to be incredibly supportive of massive issuance.  It reminds me in some ways of risk measures, where risk is highest when measures of risk are actually lowest.  The Treasury markets seem to be telling us that the supply will have infinite demand, but that should make us nervous.  It does strike me that the Treasury market won’t get slowly but surely uncomfortable with these debt-to-GDP ratios, but rather that it might come in a hurry.  If it does, I think the consequences, both for the real economy and the challenges we face in monetary policy, will become quite remarkable. Now, when might that moment come?  I don’t know.  But I would say that the debt-limit issue that the Congress and the Administration will be debating, most likely over the course of 116 of 212\f",
      "November, might well be that catalyst.  This debt-limit discussion has had a partisan nature to it going back about 20 to 25 years, but I wonder whether or not there is just enough in the air about fiscal sustainability that we should pay particular attention to what the Treasury markets are telling us in the forthcoming period. Finally, on inflation, I have to agree with the emerging consensus among many folks in this room about the pressure on wages, given various measures of slack.  Going against that theme, though, it does strike me that if the dollar continues to weaken against foreign currencies, and, for whatever reason, whether because of global final demand or something else, commodities continue to strengthen, these crosscurrents will be hitting each other.  How they net out for measures of inflation and inflation expectations strikes me as a paramount challenge for policymaking.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Now that the economy has stabilized and  looks as if it’s beginning to recover, albeit perhaps tentatively, I think it’s time to start calibrating our policy stance a little more carefully.  You argued, I think quite convincingly, for the array of factors affecting the outlook, and obviously the implication is the great uncertainty about just how that balance of forces is going to play out.  And you argued compellingly, I think, as well for nuance in our views.  And I think that needs to be reflected in our policy stance as well. The maximum amounts for our purchase programs were set back in March, amidst the bleakest days of the recession.  We made very rough estimates of what was needed, based on the best analysis we could muster coming into that meeting.  But, if you read the transcript, we changed those numbers on the fly.  Things looked potentially very grim, and we picked large numbers and raised them during the meeting, and I think it was out of a sense that we wanted to convey credibility to our commitment to do what it took.  But to some extent, looking back on that, and looking back at the deliberative process, the numbers were somewhat arbitrary at the time.  We deliberately set maximums rather than predetermined amounts, so that we could take advantage of incoming information and adjust our plans accordingly.  We explicitly have acknowledged in our statements that we would monitor programs and make adjustments as warranted. We’ve talked a lot at this meeting and previous meetings about the extent to which, until now, our asset purchases have just amounted to our displacing short-term borrowing, and about the fact that our short-term borrowing has had us basically accommodating an elevated demand for reserves, and about the fact that we haven’t perhaps done much by quantitative easing until I don’t know.  But as I said yesterday, I think we’re at the point where, from here on out, every 145 of 212\f",
      "additional purchase represents additional monetary stimulus in the quantitative easing sense, as if we were continuing to cut rates. I would point out again, over $300 billion is going to be added to reserve balances from MBS settlements and the runoff in the SFP, and new MBS purchases would provide additional reserves on top of that.  If we continue with our asset purchases, my sense is that that’s going to give us further declines in rates, albeit from very low levels, and albeit of an uncertain amount, and I’ll acknowledge that it could be small, as Bill English’s analysis yesterday showed.  But my sense is that we’re going to get more stimulus than the Greenbook assumes.  Again, how much more is quite hard to know, obviously. A couple of other factors are relevant here, at least to my thinking.  First of all, it’s not clear what net stimulus the MBS purchases are providing, over and above their effect on reserves.  If you look at the OIS spread, which has been, relative to its historic fluctuations, essentially near zero for a lot of this year, it suggests we have gotten to the point where maybe MBS, which are issued by an entity that is, after all, in government receivership, is a perfect substitute for Treasuries.  And you would expect at that point that buying MBS is just like  buying Treasuries. We talked earlier this year about the effect of different purchase program strategies, whether to buy Treasuries or MBS.  The staff did the best job it could, with limited data and limited natural experiments to go on, to give us a sense of what yields would do.  But they didn’t  give us any evidence that would refute the hypothesis that you would come to naturally, from just looking at a standard model, namely, that if we’re successful in driving down MBS rates, then that would come at the expense of raising rates elsewhere in the economy.  It has never been clear to me that lowering mortgage rates is, on net, stimulative to the economy.  And I’ll admit 146 of 212\f",
      "we don’t have much evidence one way or the other, but it’s hard for me to rule out the notion that we’re just shifting credit from one sector of the economy to the other. I’m happy to stipulate, as Vice Chairman Dudley requests, that we are not worried about an exit strategy.  I’m sure we can find an exit.  The question is which exit we want to take.  I’m  fine with the idea that we can find an exit strategy that raises rates, but I think there’s an  important question as to what we are going to exit to, what regime we’re going to be in  afterwards.  And I think the open question has to do with how big our balance sheet is and what’s in it when we finally exit.  I’m sure there’s going to be resistance to selling MBS down the road—I can just sense it.  Our plans are to hold on to it, let it roll off.  There would be political   headwinds on that.  So I’m reluctant to have us essentially be the housing lender of last resort.  And it strikes me as odd that we would head towards a configuration of our balance sheet in which we’re issuing nonmonetary liabilities to fund housing debt—the political economy of that for a central bank just strikes me as odd.  And I think we ought to strive to avoid it. So all of these factors make me wary of increasing our MBS portfolio any more than we need to.  I’m not ready to say now that we ought to scale back and cancel all the rest of the purchases, but I think we need to leave our options open.  Between now and the next meeting, I think we’ll learn a lot about this quantitative easing question, if the projections are correct.  So I would argue strongly for retaining the “up to” language. On other questions, I like the idea of tapering.  I like President Rosengren’s suggestion of language that is less committal about the timing.  In particular, if we do include the phrase “second quarter,” the preposition “in” implies that we’re going to get all the way there, so it might be better to say “by the second quarter” or “by the end of the second quarter.”  That way 147 of 212\f",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Well, let me try to summarize.  First on the substance, we’ve all agreed that the intermeeting data were more favorable—that’s a great relief, and I think to some extent it validates the approach we took back in March.  If we had known in  all encouraging.  That being said, as I mentioned in my go-round comments on the outlook, the economy does remain quite weak, certainly quite far from meeting our maximum employment objective. And there are costs on the downside—and I’m not talking about an insurance argument here; I’m talking about the neutral-risk size of the costs.  I think the downside risks are still dangerous, because on the downside lies the possibility of renewed financial crisis, and, of course, the marginal cost of higher unemployment—or less employment—is greater when you’re starting from such an adverse position.  So I don’t think that scaling back stimulus significantly  at this meeting is warranted.  Having said that, I see it as a nuanced situation.  I think it’s not right to say that we are going full bore and not in the process of exiting.  We have both actively and passively allowed the rundown of substantial amounts of our liquidity programs, and my own assumption is that, as the early 2010 deadline comes around, we will, in fact, close many, if not most, of those programs.  Second, we have ended the Treasury program.  So I think it’s clear—we’ve talked a good bit about exit—to the markets and the public that we are in a mode now of thinking about the exit and have taken some concrete steps in that direction. A second point that’s come up, which I think is an interesting one, is, to put it most bluntly, the question of whether completing the $1¼ billion of MBS purchases is a further easing or a staying in place.  Because I’ve been focused on the asset side and on the effects on interest rates, I guess I would conclude that it’s closer to staying in place than it is to a further easing. 175 of 212\f",
      "First, mortgage rates have been fairly constant throughout this entire program, and I think that what we’ll be seeing when we stop the program is probably some backup in mortgage rates, so that measure of ease has been constant over the period of the program.  In fact, whether you believe in a stock effect or a flow effect, either one would suggest that, if you were to cut back your planned purchases, it would cause rates to rise, and it would be a tightening relative to expectations. Now, the quantitative easing theory is a little bit more ambiguous.  If we’re putting more reserves into the system, then arguably that is a further easing.  But I have two observations.  One is that those effects may be small, and the other is, as Governor Duke mentioned, that it’s uncertain to what extent the effects of that are anticipated in the markets already.  So it’s a complicated question.  My own feeling is that if we were to adopt something like alternative C and actively cut back on our plan today, not only would it be tightening in the sense of pulling back on the asset-purchase program, but it also would send a very strong signal that we were very close to exit, and I still don’t think we’re there yet.  So I do think that our options really are to continue with the program, and one of the key decisions that we have is exactly how to describe how we’re going to go forward with the program at this point. Now, there’s the other side of the question that President Yellen and Governor Tarullo and others mentioned.  If we’re unsatisfied with the situation and we think the federal funds rate ought to be minus 4 percent, why aren’t we doing even more?  Here again, I don’t think we should rule that out, but I feel some sympathy to what President Evans said, which is that, given all the uncertainties we have and the issues about our balance sheet and exit and our uncertainties about the effects of these programs, it’s not obvious that we do have a lot of ammunition left even on this unconventional dimension.  Having said that, I think we should obviously keep this 176 of 212\f",
      "possibility alive if the situation warrants it, but it’s not clear to me at this point we should be doing more either.  So I do support the language in alternative B, but there are a couple of To get to the most substantive one first, I’m not sure, Governor Tarullo, if I got your vote on the “up to” language, but, excluding your vote, I think I have five for keeping “up to,” six for dropping it, and four who were split evenly between slightly favored one or the other.

If we take away the end date, then there’s just too much uncertainty involved.  So let’s talk for a moment about the end date.  Brian, how strong is the preference of the Desk for the first quarter?  What arguments can you make about first quarter versus what I think are the two other options we’ve heard:  One is end of second quarter and the other is in the second quarter, the difference being, I guess, that the end of second quarter  theoretically could encompass a much earlier decline. \n",

      "MR. SACK.1  Thank you.  The surge in the prices of risky assets that has taken place since March cooled off over the intermeeting period, as investors took note of the economic risks that remain and the ongoing difficulties facing the financial sector.  As shown in the top left panel of the first exhibit, broad equity indexes declined modestly, on net, since the last FOMC meeting.  That is a notable downshift from the gains posted over the previous four intermeeting periods, which averaged over 8 percent per period.  The drop in equity prices occurred despite favorable earnings surprises for the third quarter.  As shown in the top right panel, more than 80 percent of the firms in the S&P 500 index beat expectations—an unusually high portion by historical standards.  However, investors also focused on the growth of revenue, which was generally less impressive, and questioned the sustainability of profit growth.  Moreover, equity prices no longer benefited from the substantial upward revisions to the economic outlook that had propelled earlier gains.  Indeed, recent economic data have been seen as mixed, and the GDP forecasts of most market participants were essentially unchanged from the previous FOMC meeting, as indicated in the dealer survey responses in the middle left panel.  One factor weighing on stocks was a growing concern among investors about prospects for financial firms.  Banks’ earnings reports continued to highlight many of the problems facing that sector, and investors also became increasingly concerned about how pending regulatory changes would affect those institutions.  As a result, financial shares lost ground over the intermeeting period, as shown in the middle right panel.  Nonfinancial firms continued to be seen as relatively healthy.  Indeed, yield spreads on corporate bonds narrowed further over the intermeeting period, although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year, as shown in the bottom left panel.   Overall, despite their sharp gains from earlier in the year, we do not see equity or corporate bond prices as stretched well beyond fundamental values.  This can be seen in the Board’s equity premium measure, shown to the right, which is wide by historical standards.  It is also reflected in recent work by the New York Fed staff on high-yield bonds, suggesting that those yield spreads are near the levels expected given the outlook for defaults.  Our assessment is that, overall, the levels of U.S. asset prices appear reasonable.   Nevertheless, this assessment could change if the very rapid gains from earlier in the year were to continue.  In this regard, the flattening out of asset prices since the last meeting could be regarded as a favorable development, as it suggests that those prices are still connected to fundamentals.  As shown in the next exhibit, Treasury yields were little changed, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting.  In part, this pattern reflects that the incoming economic news has been mixed and has not provided any clear direction for yields.  Investors also took note of the considerable volume of commentary by Fed officials.  As shown in the top right panel, FOMC members gave no less than 30 speeches in the month of October.  I’m all for Central Bank transparency, but this may be going a bit                                                   1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  4 of 201\f",
      "far.  [Laughter]  Many of those speeches were seen by the markets as containing directional information about the likely course of monetary policy, and investors saw some of those messages as conflicting with one another.  In part for this reason, investors marked down the grade they gave you on communications in our dealer survey.  Despite all of the focus on these speeches, the implied policy path was little changed, on net, as shown in the middle left panel.  Investors continue to expect policy to remain on hold until at least the middle of 2010.  This accommodative policy stance is one of the factors that market participants see as contributing to the decline in the dollar from earlier this year, as shown in the middle right panel.  The degree of angst about the dollar seems to have been building in recent months, as its weakness has been widely discussed among market participants.  A key policy question is whether the dollar movement reflects an appropriate response to the outlook for the economy and policy or whether it is the beginning of a more abrupt decline that could ultimately produce a problematic increase in inflation or inflation expectations.  We lean toward the former explanation.  The decline to date has been smooth and orderly—at a pace not much different from that seen before the fall of 2008.  In fact, over this intermeeting period, the dollar was essentially flat against our major trading partners.  Moreover, some of the recent weakening reflects an unwinding of the surge in the dollar that took place during the financial crisis.  It is also worth noting that currency options markets do not seem to be pricing in considerable odds of an abrupt dollar decline, as indicated in the pricing of risk-reversals against the euro, in the bottom left panel.  These do not show a premium for protection against sizable dollar depreciation, and in fact, are now pointed in the opposite direction.   That said, we are mindful of the risks that are present, given the widespread focus of investors on this issue.  Moreover, the Treasury market is pricing in a bit more inflation protection than was the case at the last FOMC meeting.  As shown in the bottom right panel, some measures of forward breakeven inflation rates have turned higher of late, though they are still within historical ranges.  In any event, we will closely monitor these markets for any signs that a more definitive correlation between dollar weakness and inflation expectations is developing.   As covered in your next exhibit, the Desk completed the last of its scheduled Treasury purchase operations last week.  I thought it would be useful to provide a summary of the program and to discuss its effects.  In total, the Desk conducted sixty outright purchase operations in Treasury securities, bringing the cumulative total purchases to $300 billion on the nose.  The top left panel shows the pace of purchases that we implemented over the program, including the tapering of the purchases at the end of the program.  The top right panel shows the distribution of the securities purchased across maturities.  As was announced in a Desk statement at the start of the program, the purchases spanned all outstanding maturities beyond a year, but the majority of securities purchased were in the two- to ten-year sector.  With these purchases, the Desk removed a considerable portion of the duration that was issued to the market over that period.  5 of 201\f",
      " The middle two panels indicate that market functioning has improved over the period covered by the purchase program.  The left panel shows the amount of dispersion across Treasury yields relative to our smoothed yield curve, which could be taken as a proxy for the degree to which balance sheet constraints and extreme risk aversion prevented relative value trading in the market.  This measure has come in notably, with many attributing some of that pattern to our purchases.  Liquidity measures for the Treasury market have also improved.  Bid-asked spreads have also come in from the high levels earlier this year, and the depth of market quotes, shown to the right, has risen.  Overall, the Treasury market has recovered notably from the strains during the crisis, and there are no signs that our pullback from the market is causing that improvement to reverse.   The other key issue is whether the Treasury purchases, along with the other LSAP programs, were successful at lowering longer-term yields.  Some have pointed to the fact that the 10-year Treasury yield has risen since the onset of purchases and have used that fact to argue that the program was not effective.  We do not find that argument particularly compelling.  The problem is that it fails to define the counterfactual of what would have happened to yields in the absence of the purchases.  In fact, many regression models of longer-term yields would have predicted them to rise over this period.  This can be seen from a modification of the Backus–Wright yield model from their 2007 Brookings publication, shown in the bottom left panel.  The fact that yields remain below the model’s prediction is at least suggestive that the asset purchases have had some effect.  A different approach to measuring the effects of asset purchases is based on event-study.  As was presented to the Committee earlier in the year, this exercise takes a list of dates on which important announcements were made about LSAPs and aggregates the movements in yields on those dates.  The updated results, shown in the bottom right panel, indicate that the yield movements around LSAP announcements were substantial.  Together, the regression and event-study evidence suggests that LSAP programs have had notable effects in lowering Treasury yields.  We associate these effects primarily with changes to the stock of securities, arising through a portfolio balance channel, and hence we would not expect them to unwind as purchases end.  To date, that appears to be playing out.  Indeed, the market barely noticed the end of the Treasury purchase program—which is what we had hoped would happen.   As I noted in the last briefing, we are somewhat more worried about how the programs.  Even in those markets, however, the basic message is “so far so good.”  The top panels of exhibit 4 show the pace of purchases for agency debt and MBS.  As can be seen, the Desk has begun to follow the tapering program that was decided at the last FOMC meeting.  This strategy will slowly reduce the pace of purchases while still getting to total levels consistent with the Desk directives.  For MBS, the projected path takes total purchases to $1.25 trillion.  For agency debt, the Desk directive had given us some flexibility, but we were following a path aimed at a total purchase amount of $175 billion. 6 of 201\f",
      " As could be seen in the event-study results, the effects of the LSAPs appear to have been even greater on agency securities and MBS than on Treasury securities, causing those spreads to narrow.  The middle panels show the history of spreads on the two asset classes.  As we have noted before, spreads relative to Treasury securities appear unusually tight.  Part of the concern of market participants is that the purchase programs have driven spreads to these narrow levels and that the end of the programs will cause them to move back to historical norms, pushing agency securities and MBS rates higher.  However, it is hard to judge the magnitude of this risk.  In that regard, it is worth noting that the MBS spread does not look unusually narrow when measured relative to swaps, as shown to the left.   MBS purchases may have an additional effect on MBS rates beyond their influence on option-adjusted spreads.  Purchases of MBS not only remove duration from the market; they also remove prepayment risk.  Investors generally find it challenging to hold the negative convexity of MBS associated with prepayment risk, and hence they demand an extra return to bear that risk, which keeps MBS rates higher than they would otherwise be.  The removal of a considerable amount of this risk by the Fed’s purchases could therefore work to lower MBS rates by offsetting this effect.  Accordingly, it might be useful to watch the pricing of instruments that the bottom left panel, to see if they come under any upward pressure as the Fed backs away from its MBS purchases.    Lastly, I would like to make a note about the distribution of our MBS purchases.  There was a period earlier this year when refinancing activity led to a greater amount of production of new MBS with coupons of 4 and 4.5 percent.  The Desk strategy taken at that time was to concentrate purchases in those coupons in order to soak up the new supply and facilitate this refinancing.  This can be seen in the current distribution of our MBS holdings, the dark blue bars in the bottom right panel.  More recently, we have begun to spread out our purchases into higher coupons and plan to continue to do so.  This strategy is reflected in the distribution of holdings that we project for the end of the program, shown by the light blue bars.  The purpose of this shift is to achieve greater diversification in our holdings across coupons.  The higher-coupon securities will be relatively more liquid than the lower-coupon securities in the event that mortgage rates increase, which could prove useful if the Committee wants to engage in larger amounts of dollar rolls or to conduct outright sales.   These asset-purchase programs have pushed the total size of the balance sheet up to about $2.2 trillion, as shown in the top left panel of the last exhibit.  Outright asset holdings now account for about $1.7 trillion of that total.  It is this component of the balance sheet that presents the most significant exit challenges, as those holdings will run off only slowly on their own and will therefore keep reserves in the banking system for a long time.  The staff’s work on developing tools for draining reserves and for raising short-term interest rates is advancing well, as Jim Clouse and Chris Burke will cover in their briefings.  And the market seems generally to accept that we 7 of 201\f",
      "have sufficient tools to exit.  However, market participants are increasingly looking for guidance on how the tools will be used—for example, what will be the timing of  reserves draining relative to increases in the IOER rate and what quantity of reserves will be taken out of the system.   As shown to the right, the Desk asked dealers about the likelihood of various tools being used to drain reserves.  Not surprisingly, respondents placed high odds on the FOMC using reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits.  What was more surprising was that the respondents put about 50 percent odds on using outright asset sales as well.  However, there was considerable disagreement about the likelihood of asset sales, with the responses ranging from 5 percent to 100 percent odds, as indicated by the line.  In contrast, the exit from liquidity facilities is already well along toward completion.  Those facilities were priced to facilitate their wind-down.  As shown in the middle left panel, that process has worked well, as the improvement in money unattractive to most borrowers, leading to a dramatic shrinking in the volume of activity at those programs.  Currently, only four of the programs have any outstanding volume, with the total amount of credit totaling about $200 billion.   Although the exit design has worked well overall, it might require some effort to get the remaining balances to shrink to zero in an orderly way.  Indeed, as I pointed out in my last briefing, the Fed faces an adverse-selection problem in which the remaining firms are the ones with more-limited opportunities to obtain outside financing.  With this in mind, the Federal Reserve staff has begun to engage the firms remaining in the facilities on a bilateral basis to encourage them to plan for transitioning away from the Fed’s facilities.  These discussions have already helped this process notably.  The remaining firms have received a clearer signal that such a transition is necessary and have made progress toward developing alternative liquidity plans.  As indicated in the middle right panel, the number of firms remaining in the facilities has declined, and we will continue to engage those remaining firms to ensure a smooth exit.   I will close by discussing another issue in money markets—the approaching year-end.  The bottom left panel shows the estimated effect of the year-end on the two-month LIBOR rate and compares it with the levels observed at this point during past year-end periods.  Unlike previous year-ends, we are not seeing much upward pressure on the LIBOR rate.  This observation could reflect the fact that the demand for unsecured credit is fairly limited given the abundance of reserves and liquidity in the system.    Where we may see some unusual behavior over the year-end is in the Treasury bill yields and GC repo rates for Treasury collateral to turn negative over year-end.  Indeed, the implied forward rate for bills for the week spanning year-end is already at  8 of 201\f",
      "around minus 15 basis points, as shown in the bottom right panel.  This is not an unusual degree of softness relative to other short-term interest rates; however, it is notable because, given the low absolute level of rates, this softness pushes the yield into negative territory.  This consideration raises a policy question of whether the Federal Reserve should use its balance sheet to offset such a development.  We could do so by supplying more Treasury collateral to the market, either by a special TSLF operation over year-end or through reverse repurchase agreements.  As for now, we are inclined to think that mildly negative Treasury yields are not problematic and would not require such a policy response.  However, any signs that the rates are going more deeply negative and are causing disruption to market functioning could change that assessment.  Thank you. \n",

      "MR. LACKER.  Yes.  On the swap lines, I have never been a real big fan of these.  My affection rose slightly earlier in the year, but it was a transitory rise.  [Laughter]  I find my enthusiasm waning.  Basically, I don’t think they solve an economic problem worth solving.  We  have dollars out there, and maybe I am just really sanguine about the ability of the system to move dollars around.  I guess at the end of the day that might be where we differ.  It has the disadvantage of our having to police other central banks’ use of the funds and not let them do foreign exchange with them and all.  So, broadly speaking, I wouldn’t favor it because I think we can maintain the operational capability without the authorization for these things.  I think we can practice these things some way or another.  I think we can manage to maintain our human capital. On the foreign currency swaps, where we borrow a foreign currency in order to lend to one of our institutions, I think at this time horizon, nine months down the road, the vulnerability of any of these institutions, because of maturity transformation in a foreign currency, is entirely endogenous.  It is entirely the choice of how they run their business, and I don’t think there is any excuse at this horizon not to have pushed them out of the nest.  I don’t know the details of these institutions, but I think we ought to be working toward pushing them to run their business in a way that they are not so vulnerable to that. As for the NAFA things, I think those are classic foreign exchange.  It’s a vestige of our classic foreign exchange currency swap things that we have always opposed.  They are really  fiscal policies—the same reasons that Vice Chairman Dudley articulated. I am glad to hear that RCAs are on hold.  I didn’t think they were worth pursuing, and they seemed to benefit mainly the GSEs.

I don’t know why we wouldn’t go to asset sales first.  If our balance sheet were as small as it would be, let’s say, nine months from now without these deposits, would we issue a bunch of deposits to buy MBS?  I don’t think we would do that.  I don’t know why we would avoid selling MBS over the near term as we want to scale back reserve balances.  I think we ought to grapple with just how much urgency these things require before we go public and get everybody all excited about them. tools. \n",

It is really a comment in support of moving quickly, with a sense of urgency, counter to what President Lacker said, on the reverse repo counterparties and all of the other tools.  I think we need to address any uncertainty about our ability to drain.  As I understand it, if we are going to make a decision to tighten or even signal in our statement that we are moving in the direction of tightening through the rate mechanism, we need to be able to execute an operation to move the federal funds rate, and that is going to require the draining of lots and lots of reserves. If we find that it is not feasible, realistically, to drain reserves in a time frame that is going to allow us to execute rate policy, then we are probably opting for an interest on reserves policy rate that is somewhat independent of the level of excess reserves.  And if we are going to opt for that, then we need to begin to educate the market that our implementation of monetary policy is through interest on reserves.  So that is what I am thinking.

      "MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, at our last meeting I portrayed our economic outlook from  the Dallas perspective for the nation.  It resembled a checkmark, as you may remember, with a snapback in the third and fourth quarters, in the 3-plus percent range, before settling into a lower-shaped grade on the elongated side of the checkmark.  And you asked, I presume at the time only partially tongue in cheek, whether I was talking about that or a square root sign.  So I have given that a great deal of thought in the interim.  [Laughter]  And I have explored with my colleagues and our business contacts the dynamics surrounding 2010, and that is what I want to talk about this afternoon. Now, the near-term outlook seems to have improved measurably because of the stabilization of inventory investment and a leveling-out of consumer demand; the effects of the fiscal initiative, like “cash-for-clunkers” and the tax initiatives surrounding housing; and the strengthening of demand for U.S. exports.  Certainly, the securities markets are healthier.  The cost of money for those who have access to the securities markets—large businesses, not small businesses—has declined; levels have declined to very palatable levels. Despite these short-term improvements, we are, in my view, very far from being out of the woods.  I am going to reflect some of the comments that have been made by others, starting with President Lockhart.  Wage and salary increases have fallen sharply.  Household finances are still under severe strain.  The deteriorating performance of consumer and CRE loans are still exerting new pressures on the financial system.  And the plethora of new economic and regulatory initiatives is creating uncertainty among business decision makers as referred to by President Lockhart—uncertainty that appears to be retarding commitments to expansions of the workforce and to a commitment to cap-ex in the United States.  I think that the Greenbook baseline forecast underestimates the continuing drag on the economy from damage to the 76 of 201\f",
      "financial sector, deterioration and weakness in household cashflows, and uncertainty created by the new government initiatives.  It also assumes, in my view, a too-rapid response of the unemployment rate through a reduction in the output gap when these reductions finally do begin to take hold.  My survey of CEOs confirms some of this drag. I do think it is important to footnote our research and that of the St. Louis Fed in publications from a couple of years ago that look at the last nine recessions and recoveries since 1954.  They show that there is a strong correlation between the lengthy expansion before the recession and the degree of what we in Dallas call “jobfulness” of the ensuing recovery.  That is, there is a lot of talk about a jobless recovery.  That is really not the issue.  The issue is how many jobs are generated by an ensuing recovery.  Inefficiencies in the use of labor and other factors accumulate with time.  The longer the time since the last recession, the greater the wave of reorganizations that follow.  Reorganizations lead to a shedding of jobs within firms for an extended period of time during the correction or the recovery, and thus they create and contribute to the degree of jobfulness of that recovery. This is confirmed by the behavioral patterns that I am hearing from my corporate contacts.  These contacts continue to be pessimistic about the prospects for top-line growth for 2010, though they generally feel that revenues have bottomed out.  They still plan to operate in a cost-containment mode.  They report little—actually no—enthusiasm for expanding payrolls and cap-ex.  This is very evident if you look at the large what I call logistics companies—Fluor; Bechtel; Kellogg, Brown & Root; and others—are actually beginning to let people go.  Fluor’s CEO said that “domestic cap-ex is dead”—a pretty harsh statement.  The most negative in terms of cap-ex was AT&T.  It reports that it cut cap-ex 15 percent in 2009.  I mention it because, 77 of 201\f",
      "arguably, it is the largest single committer of cap-ex; roughly $18 billion a year was budgeted for 2010.  At the same time, it is budgeting a head-count cut of 12,000 employees in 2010. The most positive I talked to, such as Texas Instruments, are budgeting some  opportunistic cap-ex increases but plan no expansion of payrolls for the first half of the year, as they feel they can “continue to drive productivity higher.”  The theme of squeezing greater productivity out of existing workers, which Dave Stockton referred to in our last meeting, and out of existing assets remains a constant across all of my CEO contacts.  For example, Wal-Mart is planning on adding 11 million square feet of storage space in 2010.  Yet because of IT and other efficiency boosters, it will not increase its associated head count above 1.4 million.  It has an enormous employee base.  That 1.4 million is actually down slightly in 2009 from 2008. Regarding retail, the container ships that carry goods across the seas are operating below cost and continue to lose money.  The rails that take those goods from the ports to their distribution points report stability but no discernible pickup in end demand.  And my favorite metric, 178,000 freight cars, which would stretch 2,900 miles if laid end to end, and 28,000 locomotives have been laid up.  Even though Buffett announced this morning that he was acquiring Burlington Northern, the CEO of Burlington Northern reports that, in the same words, “Christmas is dead.”  These are not happy people that I talked to. \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much, and thanks to everybody for their valuable input.  Let me make an effort to summarize the discussions I heard at least, and then I’ll  make a few additional comments. Participants noted the recent, more-positive economic data.  After four quarters of decline, we have seen positive economic growth again, as had been anticipated, and moderate GDP growth  should continue in the fourth quarter.  Factors contributing to growth in the near term include the ongoing slowdown in the pace of inventory decumulation, fiscal actions to support autos and housing, and some signs of life in consumer spending. However, as many one-off factors affected final demand in the third quarter, it is difficult to  recovery going forward.  Most participants see the economy growing at a moderate pace in 2010, a pace that would imply a very slow decline in unemployment.  Risks to the economic growth outlook are roughly balanced, with conditions in financial and labor markets posing threats to growth but the possibility of a stronger consumer and strong productivity growth creating upside risks.  Concerns  remain about the dependence of the economy on government support and the ability of the economy  to deliver a self-sustaining recovery without that support.  One participant characterized the likely recovery as “a long slog,” and one thought of it as a checkmark, which we will continue to evaluate.    The emerging global recovery, especially in emerging markets, is supportive of economic growth here. With respect to inflation, the risks seem roughly balanced as well, with some arguing that  slack will lead to declining core inflation and others noting that rising energy prices, policy expectations, and inflation expectations that may not be as anchored as we would like are upside risks.  Some saw slower inflation in the near term but upside risks further out.  Consumer spending 114 of 201\f",
      "is modestly stronger, even outside autos.  However, weak labor markets, the poor condition of household balance sheets, declines in net worth, and tight credit are drags on sentiment and the  ability to spend.  Labor income is flat as hours decline and wage growth slows.  How the saving rate will evolve is difficult to anticipate, but further declines in the saving rate from here do seem  unlikely. Housing activity has improved, and house prices have risen modestly in some areas.  Inventories of housing are down, and we may have seen a bottom.  However, factors such as the first-time homebuyer tax credit and Fed MBS purchases may be driving that trend to some extent.   Builders, especially smaller builders, remain pessimistic.  Business owners generally remain quite cautious and continue to focus on cost savings in the absence of significant top-line revenue growth.  The resulting productivity gains have been  impressive.  However, there is substantial reluctance to hire or invest, except possibly abroad, due to uncertainty about prospective demand and about Washington’s grape-shot approach to policy.  Continued strengths in parts of the global economy, notably Asia, have helped to increase exports supporting manufacturing, though net exports are not likely to be a large net contributor to GDP growth overall. The labor market remains very weak.  As noted, firms continue to look aggressively for cost savings and see little need to hire even if demand expands.  Small businesses, which are normally a source of employment growth in recoveries, have been hit especially hard by the credit crunch and weak demand.  UI claims are falling, and job cuts are moderating, but both are still high.  The employment-to-population ratio is at a long-term low.  Firms will be able to increase hours to meet  increases in demand, delaying the need to add to payrolls.  We must take account of the possibility of a jobless recovery. 115 of 201\f",
      "Financial markets have shown signs of healing, with asset prices much higher than earlier this year and credit spreads much narrower.  More recently, though, the markets have moved sideways reflecting uncertainty about recovery, and continued improvement is not guaranteed.  Large firms with access to public markets are having little difficulty obtaining credit.  They also hold plenty of cash.  Smaller, bank-dependent firms are having a more difficult time, however.  The  situation for banks is mixed.  Rising nonperforming loans will be a continuing source of stress, but  there is some optimism about future credit losses, and profits and liquidity are both improved.  Poorly rated banks, in particular, are not lending but are trying to improve their capital ratios by  shedding assets, and many participants cited commercial real estate as a major concern both for the banking system and for the broader economy.  Banks are also affected by policy uncertainty both here and abroad. Finally, on inflation, core inflation and median inflation are slowing, but headline inflation will be increased somewhat by price increases in energy, commodities, and imports.  Wages and   unit labor costs have slowed, the latter reflecting sharp gains in productivity.  Firms report that they have no pricing power.  Participants continue to disagree on the appropriate weights to place on  resource slack, inflation expectations, and other factors in forecasting inflation.  Substantial resource slack and slow wage growth may tend to push inflation down; on the other hand, inflation expectations may be less anchored and more disperse than they appear and could be vulnerable to  the public’s concerns about the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions that have been taken or to disorderly declines in the dollar. Participants discussed the measurement of market expectations of monetary policy; the need to communicate exit plans and to exit at the appropriate time; the need to allow asset purchases and other aspects of policy to respond on the margin to changes in economic outlook; and the 116 of 201\f",
      "determinants of inflation expectations and potential output.  That’s my summary.  Comments, reactions? proceed. All right.  Let me make just a few additional comments here.  As everyone has noted, the intermeeting data were modestly encouraging.  We saw third-quarter economic growth, and we  expect the fourth quarter to be positive as well.  Markets have become somewhat more uncertain, though, about the durability of the recovery and also perhaps about how this Committee will The issue remains for everyone, I think, what will happen after the end of this year—how  the recovery will look in 2010.  At the last meeting I described my outlook as muddled, and I remain firmly in that position.  [Laughter]  If pressed, however, I would acknowledge that I feel  somewhat more concerned about 2010, although I did make my balance of risks balanced.  As many  of you have noted, the behavior of the consumer is very important, and I guess the good news, at  least from a cyclical point of view, is that the Greenbook seems right so far that we’re not seeing a major increase in the household saving rate that would be, at least in the short term, a problem for   the recovery.  However, I do think there are some significant downside risks to that scenario, particularly in the labor market and the banking sector, and let me just talk about those a bit.  As Governor Kohn  mentioned, the saving rate actually is quite low, given many of the fundamentals, and it seems very possible that it may rise if the labor market remains as weak as it appears.  I would like to discuss  the labor market briefly because I think we really need to focus on the labor market as one of the key elements of the recovery. My sense is that, even given the bad headline numbers in terms of unemployment and payrolls, the labor market may be even weaker than it looks.  For example, insured unemployment 117 of 201\f",
      "on regular state programs, the UI claims we check every Thursday morning, have peaked and come   down significantly, and the outstanding stock of people on unemployment insurance is down to  about six million.  But when you look at UI claims plus regular UI plus extended and emergency benefits, the number is ten million and has not peaked.  It is still very, very high.  Recently the BLS announced benchmark revisions that will lower the level of employment by another 850,000 jobs.  So joblessness, employment-to-population ratios, and so on are extraordinarily high.  Moreover, that joblessness has a very large component of permanent separations and long-term unemployment.  As we’ve seen in the last two recessions—looking at JOLTS data, for example—hiring rates are particularly weak, particularly contributing to the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment, which is not encouraging as we look forward to the possibility of a jobless  recovery. Just note that different demographic groups are reacting differently to the very poor state of  the labor market.  Prime age males who have high attachment to the labor force have not dropped  out of the labor force, but their unemployment rate has jumped much more significantly than that for the labor force as a whole.  On the other hand, younger workers under age 24 have been dropping out of the labor force, and participation rates there are considerably down.  So my first  general point is just that the weakness is perhaps even worse and more pervasive than the unemployment rate may suggest. Second, looking forward, there’s not much indication of increased hiring, at least in the medium term.  You can see that in anecdotes we heard today.  You can see that in surveys, and I think there is the point that others have made, but is worth mentioning again, that, despite all the cuts, despite the cost savings, firms have quite a bit of capacity to increase labor input without  adding full-time workers, including calling back workers on furlough, adding hours to part-time 118 of 201\f",
      "workers, increasing work weeks and adding overtime, and adding temporary workers, which adds to the number of people employed but not obviously to longer-term employment. A third point is that jobless recoveries almost by definition involve high productivity growth  rates, and all of the indications so far suggest that, in fact, employers are finding those cost savings, which of course is good for the long term but again is a negative for future employment.  Then the fourth and final point I want to make about the labor market is that we need to think about the interaction between the labor market and the credit markets.  There is a tremendous  contraction going on in bank lending.  Nominal C&I bank loans outstanding are down about 12 percent, or $200 billion, over the past three quarters, and although we have seen some improvement in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, we still have net tightening in that area.  As people have noted, for large firms the bank lending contraction may not be such a big problem.   They have access to the public markets, and they have lots of cash.  But for small firms, I think it is a serious problem, as many of you have heard from your constituents.  Not only are bank lending and bank credit lines for small firms highly restricted, but in addition, you have the greatly reduced availability of home equity lines and credit card lines, which are important for very small businesses  as a source of credit.  As a result of this, the small business hiring plans as reported by the NFIB are sharply below the troughs of 1990 and 2001 and have not improved at all from the worst levels of earlier this year. Now, there is an ongoing debate on the importance of small business in job creation.  There are some exaggerated numbers out there that are often used in political discourse.  The net creation of jobs by small businesses is much less than the gross creation because of the rapid turnover of small firms, but that’s a steady-state observation.  In the growth phase of the business cycle, because small businesses are so cyclical, they actually contribute substantially, perhaps 40 percent or more, 119 of 201\f",
      "to job additions during a recovery.  So the credit problems that they face could be an important problem directly affecting employment. Let me just say a couple of words about the credit crunch and banks.  I was encouraged to  hear Governor Duke’s views on banks.  There are some encouraging signs in terms of profitability, liquidity, and credit quality.  Nevertheless, as I mentioned before, the actual lending, the willingness  to lend, and loans outstanding are quite constrained, and we’re seeing again very sharp declines in outstanding credit.  An interesting question is whether or not the declines in credit in the banking sector are the normal response to a deep recession or whether there is something additional going on.  I may have remarked on this before, but to try to test that we’ve done vector auto regression analysis that includes bank credit, nominal GDP, and terms and conditions of lending, indicators from the SLOOS.  And what you find, interestingly, is that the decline in lending can be explained by the combination of slow growth and tighter conditions.  So in that respect it is normal, but the  tightening of conditions itself is far greater than would be expected historically given the decline in the economy.  So what seems to be happening is that firms are making loans, but they are doing so under unusually tight terms and conditions, even conditional on the depth of the recession.  Now, there are two possible explanations for that.  One is that credit quality is worse than usual even given the state of the recession.  The other is that banks’ own problems, capital and so on, are restricting credit.  In either case, that is concerning and suggests that the financial headwinds will be there as we go forward.  Again, I do think that both the labor market and the credit markets are going to be very  formidable issues going forward and make a moderate-to-slow recovery more likely than a rapid recovery.  That being said, I just want to say for the record that there are some upside risks to 120 of 201\f",
      "economic growth as well, and they’re a little harder to identify almost by necessity since one never knows where growth is going to come from, but these are important considerations. I want to talk once more, as I did last time, a bit about implications of low interest rates.  I think most would agree that there is a good policy case from the economy’s point of view for  maintaining low rates.  But I think we also would all agree that we need to continue to monitor any possible side effects from low rate policies that might be concerning.  One set of issues is speculative excesses, and I will say that we are trying here at the Board—and I hope you will at the Reserve Banks as well—to monitor even more closely than usual the state of asset prices as they  evolve.  My sense is—and Brian Sack talked about this yesterday—that U.S. asset prices, so far at  least, do not show any strong evidence of mispricing or asset bubbles.  In particularly, equity premiums are still above normal, so stock prices don’t seem unusually high.  Bond spreads seem reasonable given expected default rates in the state of the economy, and so on.  So in the United States so far—though as I say, we need to continue to monitor it—I don’t see that as being a near- term concern, although there is obviously a lot chatter about it, and that is one reason I think we  need to be particularly attentive.    There is more concern about what is happening in Asia, where some markets seem to be   overheated.  I just would make a point there, which is that the link between those asset prices in Asia and our monetary policy may be weaker than is sometimes believed.  There is a view espoused in some quarters that, because of the exchange rate management in Asia, Federal Reserve policies are essentially just imported into the Asian economies and, therefore, are a source of overheating in  those economies.  A recent paper here at the Board by Erceg, Guerrieri, and Kamin looks at that  from a number of different perspectives.  One of the interesting points that they make is that, if you look at the monetary policy indicators—short-term interest rates, for example—in Asian countries, 121 of 201\f",
      "including China, and compare them with the U.S. federal funds rate, you see quite a bit of divergence because of capital controls and because of imperfect substitutability among assets.  Asia  does seem to have some ability to conduct independent monetary policy.  In that respect they obviously need to conduct policy that’s appropriate for their region.  In addition, they have various  kinds of quantitative controls on credit and on prices, and they also have fiscal policy.  So I think we need to pay attention to the Asian situation, but I would caution us not to overstate the responsibility of our policy for those excesses. A second area that we need to pay attention to in terms of the side effects from the low   interest rates is the behavior of the dollar.  There were some anxious moments in the markets during  the intermeeting period, but if you look at the pattern of the dollar over the last year or so, it seems  to have been a fairly predictable and orderly evolution.  What we have seen, of course, is a rise in  the dollar associated with safe haven demand and then an unwinding of that safe haven demand as the financial markets have improved.  Indeed, the current value of the dollar is about the same as it  was before the crisis, the same as in June 2007, and nominal and real broad indexes are either equal to or higher than what they were in 1995.  So we see that there is not a really large secular movement in the dollar.  Moreover, a lower dollar may be necessary—we don’t know for sure—to  address the current account situation.  The other relevant fact, I think, is that so far we don’t see any evidence of a shift away from the dollar in reserve holdings.  But all that said, an orderly depreciation is orderly until it’s not orderly, and then at that point there may be a change, and we monetary system, and obviously it also has implications for commodity prices, inflation  expectations, and so on, which could force our hand or hamper our policy in ways that we would  122 of 201\f",
      "otherwise not want to go.  So, again, I think that this is an area that we need to continue to pay  attention to. I’ve talked about inflation before.  I’m not going to reiterate.  I think we’re all waiting for Jeff Fuhrer and the presentation in December to finally resolve all of the differences on the  Committee about the dynamics of inflation.  [Laughter]  So I’ll leave my views until that time. I will just once again close by saying that one of the important elements—I think everyone agrees—is to demonstrate that we can and will exit at the appropriate time from our extraordinary  policies.  The presentation yesterday about the progress being made on reverse repos and term deposits, the winding down of our liquidity programs, and so on shows that we are in fact, more so than some other countries, moving back toward a more normalized type of policy, which I think, when we are able to do that, would be very good news.

Getting more specific about where that endpoint is, where we think we want to get to as we come to more normal policy, would be helpful to us, and then working backwards to figure out the transition we want to get there.  I think this is a really good exercise for us to be doing, and so I would encourage you to keep pursuing that, and thinking about that endpoint would be a useful addition to thinking about that. \n",

Mr. Chairman, when the first draft of alternative B came out, it dropped economic conditions and just listed these three factors, and I commented to Brian that I thought that was just too narrow because it was so closely focused on these three factors.

      "MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor the language of alternative B.  I agree with President Plosser that the passage of time and the confirmation of the upturn in the economy brings exit closer, but the outcomes are still quite unsatisfactory through 2012, certainly by my forecast.  And looking at the central tendency of the Committee’s forecast, as Brian pointed out, in 2012 we still have resource utilization a couple of percentage points below where we think it should be over the longer run and inflation below where we think it should end up.  So being constrained at the lower bound, we’re not in any way at an optimal setting, and I think it will be quite a while before we tighten.  I had my tightening in mid-2011.  I think President Plosser and President Lacker have   raised interesting points about how to structure the exit and what to do, and so we have all next year to discuss it.  [Laughter]  Doesn’t that sound like fun?  Paragraphs 1 and 2 to me present the right picture, which is that not much has changed since the last meeting, and that’s the consensus here.  So I’m happy with that language.  Obviously, with my policy expectations, I feel very strongly that we ought to retain the “extended period” language. With regard to the three factors in here, I think that’s a good idea.  Those factors are related  to our mandate, and to my mind, levels are very important not only because of the legislative  mandate but also because they make sense in my economic model.  Adding those factors underlines that it’s a conditional forecast that talks about the economic conditions, and it gives us some   elements to talk about as we edge closer to exit, whenever that might be.  I like that the words  “anticipate” and then “are likely to” give a certain forward-looking aspect to it, and that’s right.  We  should be thinking about what those factors are going to be in four or eight quarters, not necessarily  what they are today.  I think that President Lacker is right:  The “including” language suggests that something else might be out there.  It gives us some flexibility.  To my mind, these issues about the  dollar and asset prices would play primarily through these three factors that we have here and 148 of 201\f",

I agree with specifying the $175 billion.  That’s the path we’re on.  Why not reduce  uncertainty as long as we’re clear about the fact that it’s because of the market functioning that we’re doing this and we’re not really pulling back policy.

If we drain $300 billion of reserves by dumping a bunch of collateral into the RP market, do we not only get the effect in exhibit 27, but do we also get further upward pressure on the RP rate from that collateral?  I think we see that as a possibility—that is, you could actually get some further upward pressure on RP rates relative to overnight rates.  I think that would tend to be transitory, but certainly if that collateral were dumped quickly that could happen.  But generally speaking, and over longer periods of time, we think the main effect comes via affecting the amount of liquidity available in the overnight lending market, in which case draining enough liquidity tends to pull rates up towards the IOER  rate. \n",

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have had some heartening news since the last meeting.  In particular, the employment report was stronger than most analysts expected, with the economy losing only 11,000 jobs.  However, it is obvious, but still important, to emphasize that this is still moving in the wrong direction.  As the recovery progresses, a good employment report will be one that adds jobs substantially faster than growth in the labor force, so we can make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate and reattaining full employment. The Greenbook has the unemployment rate at 9.6 percent at the end of 2010, with an assumption of no change in the federal funds rate.  Unfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain quite elevated.  We need to see a significant reduction in job loss and a marked increase in hiring if we are going to achieve net increases in employment that significantly exceed growth in the labor force.  Other labor market  trends highlight why the progress is likely to be slow in bringing the unemployment rate down.  First, the fraction of employed persons working part-time for economic reasons is nearly at an all-time high for the series.  Second, the workweek of production and non-supervisory workers remains low relative to non-recessionary periods.  With many workers on a reduced workweek, or involuntarily on part-time work, many businesses will defer hiring new employees until their existing workforce is more fully utilized.  Thus, even if GDP growth exceeds potential, as I expect it will over the coming quarters, this will likely reduce the unemployment rate only gradually. Headwinds from the banking sector are also likely to continue to blow strongly.  The percent of bank assets in institutions with low supervisory ratings continues to grow, and bank failures are artificially being held down by resource constraints at the FDIC.  Given the volume 47 of 247\f",
      "of problem loans and problem banks, it is probably time to have a Resolution Trust Corporation to deal with failed bank assets.  Recovery in commercial real estate will be delayed if the public and private sectors hold large inventories of problem commercial real estate loans in the hope that losses will be avoided through forbearance.  On the inflation front, there is little evidence of inflationary pressures.  A variety of models used by the Boston Fed expect continued disinflation.  For models that depend on resource slack, the very high unemployment rate relative to any reasonable estimate of full  employment suggests further disinflation.  However, recognizing the difficulties in measuring unemployment and output gaps, we have also examined models that emphasize the role of real have been falling dramatically and are currently at a postwar low.  With double-digit unemployment, I don’t expect a quick reversal in real unit labor costs.  Furthermore, our model suggests that, even in the presence of extremely well-anchored inflation expectations, the downward pull from resource underutilization may well outweigh the stabilizing effect of  anchored expectations. Thus, while the high-frequency data have clearly improved from earlier this year, they have not changed enough to significantly alter the outlook of an economy with very weak labor \n",

The unemployment rate is at 10 percent, and core inflation is below my guideline of 2 percent. I agree with the economic markers that are listed in the paragraph on inflation—the rates will remain low for an extended period of time due to low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, and I do put substantial weight on all three of those. I was fascinated to hear Governor Kohn’s discussion of real rates and how the natural real rate might be low for some period of time.  That did stand in contrast to President Plosser’s discussion about how policy really might need to chase the real rate up.  As Don discussed, there’s a need to replace consumption expenditures and other types of investment, and I believe that, inherent in Charlie’s commentary, he did not have that same type of need.  Really, this is just resource slack finding its way into a real rate discussion.  I think it bodes well for us to have a robust discussion of these issues and recognize that it finds its way into a number of different Although the unemployment rate is 10 percent and is expected to improve only slowly— that’s the bad side—I still believe that a funds rate at about zero plus our large balance sheet is about as much as we can do and as much as we should do.

      "MR. DOTSEY.4  Thanks, Jeff.  Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, our presentation summarizes two important concepts: inflation persistence and output gaps.  These seemingly disparate concepts are linked through the Phillips curve.  We  argue that interpretations  of inflation persistence and output gaps derived from  Phillips curve models are sensitive to assumptions made in estimating these models and assumptions made about the nature of shocks entering the models.  Unfortunately, there is not always a sound basis for choosing among candidate assumptions.  As a result, basing policy discussions on measures of persistence or output gaps may not be productive.  Our work shows that:  (1) observed inflation persistence may be the result of monetary policy choices and thus cannot be used to infer structural features of the economy; (2) statistical measures of output gaps are not useful in formulating monetary policy; and (3) theoretical measures of output gaps may in principle be helpful for guiding policy, but in practice they are probably not.  Let me turn my attention to my first topic, inflation persistence.  To investigate the potential sources of inflation persistence, we used a simple sticky price model.  In this model, the New Keynesian Phillips curve accounts for deviations of inflation from average, or trend, inflation.  In looking at inflation over the last 50 years, it appears that inflation can be characterized as a process having a time-varying mean.  Thus, how one models trend inflation has important implications for the structure of the model.  If trend inflation is changing over time and is modeled as changing over time, then the New Keynesian Phillips curve needs to account only for the deviations of inflation from a changing trend, not for overall inflation.  Thus, a New Keynesian Phillips curve estimated on deviations from trend inflation will predict less backward-looking indexation or shock persistence.  There will be fewer structural rigidities than if the trend is depicted as a constant.  To clarify the sources of inflation persistence, consider the reduced-form New Keynesian Phillips curve on page 3 of the handout.  This equation indicates that there are several potential sources of inflation persistence.  Inflation can be persistent because marginal cost is persistent, because markup shocks are persistent, because prices are indexed to past inflation, or because the inflation trend is itself persistent.  It seems natural to interpret a time-varying inflation trend as the result of a drifting inflation target.   We estimate our simple model for two specifications of the inflation trend, a specification with a fixed inflation target and a specification with an inflation target that follows a random walk.  We find that allowing for a random walk inflation target reduces the overall contribution of indexation and markup shocks to inflation persistence.  Further, the random walk inflation target specification is statistically preferred to the constant target specification.                                                     4 The materials used by Mr. Dotsey are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).  145 of 247\f",
      "That finding implies that the persistence of inflation is, to a large degree, determined by policy.  Supporting this point is the observation that historically across countries inflation persistence depends on the monetary regime.  In particular, inflation persistence is lower in countries that are on a gold standard or where the central bank targets inflation.  The finding that inflation persistence is largely determined by monetary policy and that other sources of persistence are not very important implies that policy is fully capable of changing the behavior of inflation without generating large economic costs, especially if inflation expectations are well anchored.  Now let me turn to my second topic, the usefulness of output gaps for conducting monetary policy.  We are going to conclude that they are not very useful.   Broadly speaking, output gaps refer to the deviation of output from a level deemed to be desirable.  Thus, constructing an output gap requires one to take a stand on the desired level of output, often referred to as potential output.  There are two primary approaches to defining and measuring potential output:  those based on statistical procedures and those based on explicit theoretical models.  Statistical measures of potential output are constructed either as smoothed measures of actual output or smoothed estimates of output derived from a production function.   A second approach to constructing potential output relies on estimated theoretical models, where the behaviors of output and potential output depend on the structure of the economy and the exogenous shocks buffeting the economy.  Some features of the economy’s structure and some of the shocks hitting the economy may give rise to inefficient outcomes.  For example, monopolistic price setting and nominal rigidities introduce distortions.  In addition, markup shocks introduce inefficient fluctuations.  This suggests defining potential output as that output that could be obtained in the absence of distortions and inefficient shocks, but including the effects of shocks that are classified as efficient.  In simple versions of these models, a monetary policy that minimizes the difference between actual output and the model-based definition of potential output, that is, the model-based output gap, is welfare improving. Thus, in principle, model-based output gaps may be useful for policy purposes.  In contrast, the statistical measures of the output gap are less useful for policy purposes, because these measures need not be closely related to model-based gaps.  For example, in figure 1 of the handout we consider a productivity increase in an economy with sticky nominal prices.  With sticky prices, output responds more sluggishly than it would if prices were flexible.  Because of this, potential output rises by more than actual output, and the theoretical output gap is negative.  However, if we were to graph a statistical measure of potential, which is a smoothed version of actual output, it would rise by less than actual output, producing a positive output gap.  Thus the model-based output gap and the statistical-based output gap would move in opposite directions and imply different monetary policy responses.  This example illustrates why we think it unwise to base policy on statistical-based gaps.    146 of 247\f",
      "However, at this stage of model development, we are also uncomfortable with using model-based gaps for policy purposes.  First, in more complicated models, the output gap is no longer a sufficient statistic for evaluating the welfare implications of  monetary policy.  Moreover, the models are still preliminary.  In addition, shocks play an important quantitative role in these models, but the economic interpretation of  many of these shocks is unclear.  While we have come to accept productivity shocks as structural, we have not yet reached that comfort level with many of the new “structural” shocks coming out of New Keynesian Phillips curve models.  It is also of importance that different models may produce very different measures of the output gap.  In figure 2 we plot the output gaps from three representative models.  The blue line represents the output gap from our small-scale model, the green line is the output gap from a medium-scale New Keynesian Phillips curve model developed by my colleague Keith Sill, and the two red lines represent alternative output gaps from the Board’s larger-scale EDO model.  It is abundantly clear that the output gaps from these different models are very different.  We, therefore, are not confident that, given the current state of knowledge, one can rely on model-based gaps as sufficient indicators for monetary policy.    On a more positive note, we believe that the process of formulating and estimating a particular model can be quite useful for policy purposes.  Estimation can inform a policymaker about the shocks that the model suggests are impacting the economy.  If the shocks have been correctly identified, the model can be a useful guide to policy.  A general lesson from our models is that it is not enough to know that output is high or low relative to trend to conclude that output is high or low relative to potential; rather one needs to know something about the shocks hitting the economy and the assumed structure of the economy.  It seems more appropriate that policy discussions should proceed based on explicit discussion of these shocks, rather than the implied gaps.   From this we conclude that the use of models in policy discussions is beneficial.  Also, because we have no agreed-upon model, it is useful to consider the implications from a number of models, and it is certainly not necessary that all the models be of the New Keynesian variety.  It is only the careful consideration of a full range of imperfect models that enlightens and places discipline on policy discussions.  In that regard, the Chicago exercise falls into the class of exercises that we find productive.  They provide a detailed exposition of their model, the various variables constructed using their model, and the contribution of shocks to these constructs.  This is consistent with the way we suggest policy discussions be conducted.  We are, however, more skeptical of the specifics of their exercise.  They find that their measure of potential output, which conforms to our definition of potential, helps explain another model construct that they call “fundamental inflation.”  We don’t think this is much of a surprise.  Fundamental inflation is the part of detrended 147 of 247\f",
      "inflation generated by efficient shocks in their model absent inefficiencies and is thus constructed similarly to the way they construct potential output.  That strategy increases the chance that those two constructs will be correlated.  However, this correlation is not necessarily useful for policy purposes.  In particular, fundamental inflation is only weakly correlated with actual inflation, implying that their model, like most models, doesn’t provide a good structural explanation of inflation.  Therefore, from an academic perspective, their results are very interesting, but from a policy perspective less so, because knowing the Chicago measure of potential output tells us very little about actual inflation.  This is a key point of the Philadelphia-Richmond presentation.  And now I’ll turn it over to Mark.  \n",

      "MR. SACK.1  Thank you.  A variety of factors affected financial markets over the intermeeting period but did not provide them with a consistent direction.  Incoming economic data were generally seen as mixed, leaving market participants with a roughly unchanged forecast of economic growth going forward.  Even in that environment, the prices of risky assets had been performing well over most of the intermeeting period.  However, over the past two weeks, market participants had to digest several proposals for financial sector reform that created concern about the outlook for that sector and for the economy more broadly.  In response, major U.S. equity indexes declined sharply, bringing them to a modest net loss since the last FOMC meeting, as shown in the top left panel.  Measures of implied volatility on equity prices, shown in the top right panel, increased markedly last week, largely reflecting the uncertainty associated with the reform initiatives.  Corporate bonds, in contrast, rallied on net over the intermeeting period, as shown by the yield spreads in the middle left panel.  It had appeared that the spreads were leveling out in the latter parts of 2009, but their tightening trend has strongly reemerged.  The sizable narrowing of corporate spreads since early 2009 has been driven in large part by fundamental factors, including the shift in the economic outlook, the diminution of downside economic risks, and the improving access of corporations to capital markets.  However, those fundamental factors explain only a portion of the movement, as a reduction of the risk premium has also played an important role.  One measure of the risk premium for the high-yield index is shown in the middle right panel.  As can be seen, it has come in sharply, but much of this movement was simply retracing the sharp increase in 2008.  By this measure at least, the current risk premium does not appear unusually narrow by historical standards.  Issuance of corporate bonds has been quite strong, as firms continued to take advantage of the favorable financing conditions.  However, other parts of credit (CMBS) have narrowed some of late, as shown in the bottom left panel, reportedly because investors are increasingly looking to these products to pick up yield.  However, we have seen only a trickle of new issuance in this sector, and we do not know of any major deals that are likely to be brought to the market by the scheduled expiration date of the TALF in June.  Another area of the credit markets that remains tight is bank lending.  Banks continue to be wary of taking additional credit risk onto their balance sheets, though we may be slowly reaching a turning point in that regard.  The most recent survey of bank lending practices indicated that commercial banks generally ceased tightening standards on most types of loans.  However, this comes after an unprecedented tightening of conditions, and any substantial improvement in lending conditions is likely to be slow, given the challenges still facing those firms.  As shown in the bottom right panel, share prices for regional banks fared well over the intermeeting period, based in part on the view that the rate of deterioration of outstanding loans                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 10 of 260\f",
      "may be slowing.  However, share prices for larger banks fell back, especially after the recent reform proposals that would affect those firms.  As shown in your next exhibit, monetary policy expectations implied by federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates shifted down over the intermeeting period.  This change reflected the mixed economic data as well as FOMC communications that were read as suggesting that the Fed’s accommodative policy stance will remain in place for longer than anticipated.  Nevertheless, the overall pattern of expectations remains the same—the market expects the Fed to begin raising the federal funds rate late this year and to take it to around 2 percent by the end of 2011.  With the decline in policy expectations, the two-year Treasury yield fell modestly, on net, over the intermeeting period, as shown to the right.  Longer-term yields ended the period about unchanged.  Many bond market participants have been discussing the possibility that longer-term yields could move up notably.  They cite the risk factors that we have been discussing in recent months—namely, the heavy financing burden associated with large fiscal deficits and the challenges facing the Fed in terms of its expanded balance sheet and the political environment.  Given those perceived risks, investors have paid an increasingly large premium for protection against a sizable increase in longer-term interest rates, as can be seen from the payer skew on swaptions, shown in the middle left panel.  Because many of the risks cited focus on longer-term inflation, it may be important to closely track break-even inflation rates relative to historical ranges.  Forward break-even inflation rates from 5 to 10 years ahead have moved higher under both of the measures shown in the middle right panel.  The Board measure, for example, had moved above 3¼ percent at one point over the intermeeting period before recently pulling back closer to 3 percent.  The table in the bottom left panel compares the most recent readings of those two measures with the range observed over a period before the financial crisis, from 2002 to 2007.  Even with the recent pullback, the current reading of the Board measure is above 89 percent of the observations in the historical period.  The Barclays measure tells a more dramatic story, as the recent movements have pushed it to the upper end of its historical range.  As always, we want to be careful interpreting movements in break-even inflation rates.  For example, it is possible that the divergence in the supply of nominal Treasuries and TIPS, shown to the right, is lifting break-even rates.  One observation consistent with that view is that the nominal forward rate is well inside its historical range over the period considered in the table.  Nevertheless, given the focus that the FOMC has placed on inflation expectations, the evolution of break-even inflation rates going forward certainly bears watching.  The next exhibit addresses the Fed’s large-scale asset-purchase (LSAP) programs.  The Desk continues to taper its purchases of MBS and agency debt, as shown in the top two panels.  MBS purchases are right on track to meet the $1.25 trillion target, but 11 of 260\f",
      "the agency debt purchases have fallen behind their intended schedule because the volume of dealer offers at our operations has been relatively weak.  Unless we move above our initial plan in order to make up ground, we could end up purchasing only $170 billion or so, which we view as being sufficient to meet the objective of “about $175 billion.”  Despite the slower pace of purchases, the spreads on agency debt and MBS remain tight, as indicated in the middle panels.  An informal survey of market participants indicated that the vast majority continue to expect some widening of the MBS spread, on the order of 15 to 25 basis points, as our purchases come to a close.  However, to date the evidence is consistent with the view that the effects on longer-term rates have been more strongly associated with the stock of our holdings rather than the flow of purchases.  In that case, any effects that the purchases have had on longer-term rates should only slowly unwind as the SOMA portfolio shrinks over time.  The bottom left panel shows that the MBS market has been suffering from an unusually large volume of settlement fails in recent months.  Recall that this market generally trades on a forward basis, in what is called the TBA market, where trades settle anywhere from one to three months ahead.  Market participants who have sold securities in the TBA market have frequently been failing to deliver the securities on the scheduled settlement dates.  In part, this pattern reflects that our holdings have reduced the floating supply of current-coupon TBA securities, making it more difficult for sellers to find securities to deliver.  However, a more important factor has been the proximity of short-term interest rates to the zero bound, which significantly reduces the cost of failing.  I raise this issue because it has had implications for our purchase program.  For these same reasons, market participants could fail to make delivery of the securities they have sold to us.  Rather than accepting fails, we have been alleviating the problem by selling dollar rolls.  In a dollar roll, the seller provides its counterparty with a security for an upcoming settlement date, under agreement that the counterparty will deliver back a similar security at a subsequent settlement date, typically one month later.  By selling dollar rolls specifically to those who owe us securities at an upcoming settlement date, we in effect allow our counterparties to postpone settlement for one month in exchange for a small fee.  We believe that it will be advantageous to continue using dollar rolls in this manner in order to settle all of the outstanding purchases under the LSAP program.  This will provide the market with time to obtain and deliver the needed securities to us in an orderly fashion.  The directive proposed in the Bluebook includes a sentence that is intended to explicitly recognize that this activity will potentially continue for several months after the scheduled completion of the MBS purchases in March.  Your next exhibit focuses on the Fed’s balance sheet.  The volume of activity in our short-term lending facilities declined further over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top left panel.  This pattern, of course, reflects the fact that the facilities 12 of 260\f",
      "involve above-market rates for most borrowers, but it also reflects to a degree our efforts to encourage individual borrowers to develop alternative funding plans.  On (TAF) and the primary credit facility (the dark blue and the yellow areas in the figure).  As indicated to the right, there is very little activity in the facilities that are set to expire.  The market is not showing any strains associated with the termination of these programs.  Indeed, as shown in the middle left panel, short-term funding spreads have not moved up at all and remain quite tight.  With the ongoing decline in the liquidity facilities, the dominant component of the balance sheet has become the outright holdings of SOMA assets, as indicated by the dark blue area in the chart to the right.  Those holdings currently stand at $1.9 trillion, out of the total balance sheet of $2.3 trillion.  These outright asset holdings present the most challenging issues for exiting from the current stance of monetary policy, as they do not automatically unwind in a timely manner.  For that reason, market participants have been increasingly discussing the Fed’s use of reserve-draining tools and asset sales.  To help gauge market expectations, we conducted an extensive survey that asked respondents about how they expect the FOMC to exit from its current policy stance.  We expanded the survey beyond the economists who are typically included in our dealer survey, because many of you at the last meeting indicated that you don’t actually trust economists.  [Laughter]  This may be a good time to remind you that most of you are economists.  This survey included 17 sell-side economists, 5 sell-side interest rate strategists, 18 buy-side investors, and 13 bank funding desks.  As indicated in the bottom left panel, almost all of the respondents expected the Fed to use its temporary draining tools such as reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits as well as the IOER rate.  More surprisingly, two-thirds of the respondents also expect asset sales to be used across the three types of securities.  However, there was a very important distinction in the timing of these tools.  In particular, survey respondents overwhelmingly expected reverse repos and term deposits to be employed prior to the first increase in the federal funds target rate.  As shown in the bottom right, the mean response expected those tools to come into use about two meetings before an increase in the target rate.  Only 23 percent of the respondents expected the Fed to use the draining tools concurrently with the target rate, and less than 5 percent of the respondents thought the Fed would hike the target rate first and then drain reserves.  Increases in the IOER rate were strongly seen as occurring at the same time as an increase in the target funds rate.  In contrast, asset sales were overwhelmingly expected to occur after the first rate increase, if at all.  As can be seen to the right, the mean response put sales of agency debt and MBS about a year after the first increase in the target funds rate.  13 of 260\f",
      "The top left panel of your last exhibit shows the expected size of the various tools over time.  Market participants expect reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits to be ramped up over the period between the second quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2011, to a level of about $250 billion for each.  Asset sales are expected to occur more slowly, consistent with the responses from the previous exhibit, and to remain relatively small in size.  We also asked about the speed at which the temporary draining tools could be increased if necessary—specifically, what amount could be implemented over an intermeeting period without causing significant market disruption.  Respondents saw a surprisingly high capacity for a quick ramp-up, including $200 billion each for reverse repos and term deposits.  The ability to increase capacity quickly may explain why they on average saw these tools as being implemented only two meetings before an increase in the target funds rate.  Views about the redemption policy to be taken with SOMA assets are described in the middle left panel.  The vast majority of respondents expect the Fed either not to reinvest or to reinvest only partially its holdings of agency debt and MBS.  That is not surprising, since the approach of redeeming those assets is already under way.  More surprising, participants saw redemptions of Treasury securities also as a distinct possibility, with only 25 percent expecting full reinvestment.  Respondents’ views about the path of temporary draining policies, asset sales and redemptions, and other draining mechanisms determine how they expect the path of reserves to evolve ahead of the first change in the target funds rate.  The middle right panel shows the distribution of responses for the expected level of reserves at the time of the first target funds rate hike.  As can be seen, there is a wide range of views.  The distribution is relatively uniform from $400 billion to $1 trillion, with a few outliers instead expecting reserves to get down to very low levels.  As shown in the bottom left panel, the use of reverse repos and term deposits was seen as achieving a variety of purposes.  A minority of respondents thought that draining reserves with these tools would directly influence bank lending, for reasons independent of the implications for the path of short-term interest rates, while more than half thought it would help to contain inflation expectations.  However, the most definitive result was that the use of these tools was expected to improve the FOMC’s control of short-term interest rates.  That effect is quantified further in the bottom right panel.  We asked respondents to gauge the degree to which the effective federal funds rate might fall below the IOER rate as the IOER rate is increased.  To be sure, respondents probably have considerable difficulty predicting these outcomes, much as we do, but their estimates may still be informative.  As can be seen, the expected gap varies with the level of reserves anticipated.  At the current level of excess reserves of around $1 trillion, the interquartile range of market participants’ views spanned from 15 to 29 basis points for the IOER rate at 1 percent and went as high as 50 basis points for the IOER rate at 2 percent.  At the other end of the spectrum, respondents expected the effective federal funds rate to remain very close to the IOER rate if the 14 of 260\f",
      "level of excess reserves were to return to its historical range of $0 to $25 billion.  In between these outcomes, if roughly half of the reserves were drained, market participants expected the effective federal funds rate to remain within 25 basis points of the IOER rate.  Overall, the survey responses, I hope, provide some useful backdrop for the discussion of policy strategy that will take place after the briefings by Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton.  Thank you.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  \n",

      "CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Any other questions?  If not, we are going at this point to have a briefing and discussion on exit strategies.  Let me propose an organization for the next part of the meeting and see if everybody is okay with it. We’ll first have a briefing by Bill Nelson on discount window facilities and the TAF, and he will make recommendations about how we might proceed on these two areas.  After his briefing we can have Q&A.  We will then have a briefing by Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton on broader issues of removing policy accommodation, sequencing of excess reserves, sequencing of draining operations, asset sales, use of the interest rate on excess reserves, and so on, followed by more Q&A.  I propose that, at that point, we just do a full go-round because everyone is going to want to give their views.  Is that acceptable to everybody?  On the full go-round we will ask your views both on the discount rate and on the sequencing and structure of the exit strategy.

      "MR. PALUMBO.  Exhibit 3 turns to the outlook for consumer spending, first by describing some aspects of the substantial financial adjustment—most notably, the “deleveraging”—undertaken by households since the onset of financial turmoil.  As you can see in the top left panel, the personal saving rate shifted up from close to 1 percent in early 2008 to above 4 percent late last year.  We expect the saving rate to remain in the neighborhood of 4 percent over the medium term.  The right-hand panel shows that the rise in personal saving appears to reflect a broader retrenchment in the household sector, evidenced by a substantial reduction in the rate of household borrowing.  Household debt climbed at double-digit rates from 2003 to 2006 but A consequence of the recent deleveraging by households can be seen in the middle left panel:  Aggregate debt service payments—that is, required principal and interest on existing household debt—dropped from almost 14 percent of disposable income in early 2008 to about 12½ percent last quarter, leaving the debt service ratio at a level last seen in early 2001.  We expect this ratio to decrease somewhat further through the end of next year, as growth of disposable income outpaces household borrowing.    Turning to the right, the combination of steep decreases in home prices and stock prices cut the ratio of household net worth to disposable income from its elevated level of nearly 6½ in 2007 to 4½ in early 2009.  Since then, home prices have flattened out and stock prices have rebounded, returning the ratio of net worth to income close to its long-run average level, roughly where we expect it to stay over the projection period.    The bottom left panel provides some perspective on the behavior of consumer spending over the course of the current business cycle.  The black line shows data and our forecast for real PCE, and the red line shows the level of spending from a simulation based on one of our forecasting models that conditions only on the realized and projected values for household wealth, income, and interest rates.  (The main takeaway points are noted to the right.)  The chart shows that consumer spending began to fall short of the simulation in 2007 and then dropped far below it in 2008 and early 2009.  We think that the sharp tightening in mortgage and consumer credit and heightened anxiety about the potential depth of the recession and job loss (as evidenced by the outsized decline that occurred in consumer sentiment) played important roles in the “shortfall” in spending.  We expect consumer spending to continue to accelerate over the course of this year and in 2011, as wealth and income become more supportive of growth and as consumers regain confidence and credit becomes more available.  Exhibit 4 covers real estate markets and construction activity.  Existing-home prices, shown in the top left panel, dropped back last quarter, as we expected, after popping up in the second and third quarters.  Looking ahead, we expect prices nationwide to be about flat over the projection period, reflecting continued downward pressure from the supply side of the housing market that we think will be roughly offset by improvements on the demand side.  One indication of an abundant supply of homes on the market is the Census Bureau’s “homeowner vacancy rate” (the blue line 100 of 260\f",
      "in the panel to the right), which has remained unusually high despite being down from its peak.  In addition, the black dashed line shows that the volume of foreclosure starts picked up over the latter half of 2009, and we expect them to recede only a little this year and next, adding to the supply of homes for sale over time.  On the demand side, sales of existing homes fell back last month, broadly consistent with surge in sales was induced by the homebuyer tax credit.  Nonetheless, as noted in the middle left panel, the volume of existing-home sales rose noticeably over the second half of last year, with demand evidently lifted by the combination of low conforming mortgages rates and low home prices.  In addition, a growing sense that prices may have bottomed out in many parts of the country and a gradual increase in employment in coming quarters should contribute to rising demand.  Turning to the market for new construction, the blue line in the right-hand panel shows that sales of new single-family homes moved roughly sideways over the second half of 2009, after having increased last spring.  Nonetheless, as shown by the beige shaded area, construction has been well below sales for more than two years, resulting in a sizable liquidation of the inventory of new homes for sale.  Indeed, as the inset box reports, the inventory of new homes for sale fell from 545,000 in May 2007 to just 235,000 in November, the lowest reading in any month since 1971.  With inventories so lean, we expect construction to move up toward the level of sales during the next few quarters.  We expect the stronger overall macroeconomic conditions in 2011 to generate a rising demand for new homes that should provide a further impetus to residential construction.  The outlook for nonresidential construction is gloomier.  The bottom left panel shows that vacancy rates continued to rise through the end of last year, and prices of commercial properties fell a bit more.  As noted to the right, amid these very weak fundamentals, respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, on net, reported expecting the performance of their commercial mortgages to deteriorate further this year.  Also, relatively large net fractions of bank loan officers reported having continued to tighten CRE lending standards in recent months, as well as a further weakening in demand for these loans.  Against this backdrop, we expect nonresidential investment (outside of drilling and mining) to fall around 7 percent this year and to inch down in 2011.  A theme that continues to pervade much of the recent commentary about the macroeconomy is that conditions appear to be worse for small businesses than for large firms.  The top left panel of exhibit 5 shows that, in December’s NFIB survey, the fraction of respondents reporting plans for capital expenditures in the next six months (the blue line) remained quite low, whereas the fraction reporting credit becoming more difficult to obtain (in red) stayed high.  That said, tight credit supply is probably not the only or even the principal factor holding down their capital spending plans:  Indeed, when asked about the most important problem they face, many more small business owners cited “weak customer demand” than cited “financing conditions.” 101 of 260\f",
      "   Meanwhile, as Brian mentioned yesterday, spreads on triple-B-rated and high-yield corporate bonds—plotted to the right—dropped further in recent weeks and are now at levels last seen in late 2007.  Solid corporate balance sheets and scant defaults in recent months appear to have encouraged investors.    Turning to the outlook for equipment and software investment, the middle left panel notes a few findings from the Reserve Bank survey about firms’ plans for capital spending this year.  Looking across the responses collected by all of the Reserve Banks, almost 40 percent of firms reported that they plan to increase equipment spending, while just under 20 percent reported that they plan to decrease spending.  The most commonly cited factors by firms reporting plans to increase investment were an expectation of strong sales growth and the need to replace IT equipment.  Information about the high-tech sector from other sources has also been upbeat of late.  In the middle right panel, you can see that in the NABE survey released on Monday, more respondents expected increases in IT spending this year than expected of IT budgets in 2010.  Other reports suggest that tech spending that tends to be driven by telecommunications “traffic”—such as servers and communications equipment—is expected to continue rising robustly, while spending typically driven by “headcount”—such as personal computers and the local network gear connecting them—is more likely to pick up steam later on.    As can be seen in the bottom left panel, we now estimate that investment in equipment and software climbed at an annual rate of 12½ percent last quarter—much stronger than we projected in the December Greenbook, particularly in the transportation and high-tech categories.  Looking ahead, with solid increases in business sales and profits, strong replacement demand, and relatively inexpensive bond-market finance, we expect increases in equipment and software investment to average about 14 percent this year and next.    The right-hand panel provides some perspective on the recent investment data and our projection.  The very short bar toward the right indicates that the meager amount of gross investment undertaken in 2008 and much of 2009 was probably barely enough to cover depreciation, so that, by our estimates, the real stock of equipment and software was almost unchanged over those two years—something not seen since World War II.  Moreover, even with the double-digit growth rates of E&S spending projected for this year and next, the level of investment will still be quite low, resulting in very sluggish growth of the real E&S capital stock.

      "MR. FISHER.  And my last question, Nathan, has to do with your points on Chinese economic growth as well as on the exhibit you had on fixed asset investment.  I just want to check a data point.  If you talk to the bulk shippers, they will tell you that last year, if you look at the slippage in terms of imports on all but two countries, you had an implosion of roughly 300 million metric tons of imports.  Two hundred seventy million was made up by imports going into China and the remainder into India.  Question:  Even with a slight reduction in what you expect for Chinese economic growth, against the background that this occurred, if you look at the chart on fixed asset investment in China, there is a decline over 2009.  I am just wondering about whatever pickup we have in the rest of the world, and we expect some pickup to take place—I think the presentation captures the overall demand picture fairly accurately—could one expect then to see continued upward price pressure on dry shipments and, if so, to what degree? \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  The recent loan survey indicates to me that it is not necessarily continuing to contract, but it does remain tight.  But if I am wrong, I will withdraw the brilliant suggestion I just made. With regard to energy prices, I agree with President Plosser and the suggestion made by Bill [English] that I do not think it is necessary to have that in there.  First of all, they may be temporary, and second, it excludes other prices.  I agree with both President Plosser and Narayana on the use of the word “holdings.”  I take to the suggestion in paragraph 4 that we consider mentioning that we expect to offer $25 billion in twenty-eight-day credit at the final auction on March 8. I want to come back to one point that I’ve raised before.  We had some discussion about it last time, and actually in the last meeting President Rosengren made the excellent point that we consider the treatment of the spread on primary credit and the use of word “extended period.”  We have since had much more discussion about that.  We have agreed or at least some of us suggested yesterday that you might use your testimony on February 10, your subsequent testimony, and our investigation of our own boards to move toward normalizing the primary credit spread.  But still, like a broken record, I am uncomfortable with the words “extended period,” and I would like to make a suggestion, which is that we change that sentence after the phrase “stable inflation expectations” to read as follows: “are likely to continue to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate.”  Period.  It may be just editorializing, but as I said in the last meeting, I am a broken record on that subject, and I want to continue my record of being a broken record on that subject.

      "MR. LACKER.  It must be true then.  Probability zero.  And obviously markets put an even higher probability on it.  So I think we need to make a plan that would accommodate something that has a 30 percent chance of being something we want to do.  And that is why, as I said, I favor—and this is a point that President Bullard made—a fairly aggressive approach of reducing reserves this year. As I said yesterday also, I favor Treasuries-only because of the political entanglement issues but also because it’s likely to yield healthier growth to take out the tilt toward housing.  Then, if you think about any given path of reserve drain, using term deposit facilities or reverse RPs, as opposed to just asset sales, means continuing with more tilt toward housing than we otherwise would.  So for those reasons I am in the Treasury-only camp and the sales-only camp.  I agree with President Kocherlakota that the U.S. financial market should be able to absorb substantial sales.  In fact, I think they could absorb substantially more than he suggests. About divisibility, I think you’re right, Mr. Chairman, to suggest that we move slowly toward an exit, but there is a certain limit on the divisibility of our actions and statements.  A couple of meetings ago we debated two words about our purchase program.  We have now advanced to debating one word about our purchase program, but that’s the limit.  We can’t debate less than a word. \n",

      "MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I intimated yesterday, I see our exit strategy as composed of three phases, at least two of which overlap.  One is ending the special liquidity programs that we have.  Two is preparing, and including good communication of, a strategy for tightening.  And the third is the tightening itself.  And I do think there’s an important distinction between two and three. I am bemused, I must say, at the certainty of some of the people around the table as to the robustness and pace of a recovery, particularly given a lot of the uncertainties that the Chairman noted in his summation.  My view, again, as expressed yesterday, is a concern that a signaling of tightening and a response in markets could unnecessarily choke off what is still an uneven and somewhat fragile recovery.  At the same time, my inclination, which has only been strengthened during this FOMC meeting, is that when the time for tightening comes, it is probably going to have to be multi-tool and it may well have to be pretty muscular in order to achieve the efficacy that we are going to be looking for. The public and markets are looking much more at changes in the language that we have than in how new language might be read on its own in isolation.  So that makes me, like a number of others of you, disinclined toward any changes that might appear to be signaling a moving from phase 2 to phase 3.  So I guess I’m not looking to indicate that we are gradually moving toward the exit if that means tightening.  And it’s for that reason that I endorsed Charlie Plosser’s idea yesterday of just ending the liquidity programs as quickly as we can.  Let’s say we have done it, and we have completed that phase. For all of these reasons, I favor alternative B, both the action and most of the language.  I favor inclusion of the language that Bill English suggested on the TAF because I think that it pursues Charlie’s goal of wrapping all of this up.  But I oppose the substitution of “holdings” for 198 of 260\f",
      "“purchases,” not because it’s not potentially a useful way to begin changing the language.  I think Narayana proposes it with the intention of ongoing neutrality.

      "MR. SACK.  The staff generally thinks of the LSAPs as arising from removing the duration and other risks from the market.  So, in that sense, a credible complete commitment to sell only that amount of MBS, something equivalent to the Treasury redemptions, should have effects that are fairly comparable in size.  There are a few differences.  Selling MBS puts not only duration back to the market but also prepayment risk, and it also has different characteristics.  I think there’s perhaps some sense that the effect is slightly bigger for MBS, but it’s presumably in the same ballpark. I think an issue with asset sales is whether the FOMC would be willing to commit strongly to a gradual pace of sales.  An advantage of redemptions is that the market can look at the portfolio and have an estimate of how quickly the actual holdings would run off, and it’s credible if you are in a regime of only redeeming securities—that puts a limit on how quickly the duration gets reduced.  So the issue with asset sales is that, unless there’s an ironclad commitment in terms of the pace, the markets may always worry that the sales could end up being larger than indicated, and it would price that risk factor. \n",

And they essentially just gradually whittled down that guess over time as the effects didn’t materialize.  We sat at the table talking about when we would expect to see these effects, and they just never came, so they gradually shrank their estimates. In terms of what it means for how we assess the program, the fact that the market may not react to our moving away from the LSAPs could have two interpretations:  One is that the LSAPs didn’t do anything; the other is that the effect of the LSAPs was mainly through the stock of our holdings.  The staff, at least, puts the weight on the second argument.  The flow effects are smaller than we thought.  The stock effects are probably still there.  We believe they are there from various types of empirical evidence.  And, of course, that has important policy implications—it means that the effect on long rates isn’t going to reverse quickly; it’s only going to reverse gradually as the stock of our holdings diminishes. \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In general, the business conditions in the Third District continue to show signs of improvement since our last meeting, and the tone of our business contacts has become somewhat more positive.  The manufacturing sector shows the clearest signs of increased activity.  Our Business Outlook Survey’s general activity index has been in positive territory now for six months.  The index rose slightly in February to 17.6, and the preliminary results, which will be released on Thursday, will show another slight increase for employment index is now in positive digits.  These measures are all consistent with typical recovery patterns. months ago. Retail sales in the District have been growing slowly, with most of our contacts reporting soft sales as having been tempered somewhat by the snowstorms in February.  Firm contacts tell us they see this positive trend for retail sales on somewhat firmer footing than they did a few One of my contacts is the CFO of a very large national cable company headquartered in Philadelphia.  He reports there has been a significant pickup in their businesses in the last several months.  Last year advertising revenues were down between 25 and 30 percent.  In the last few months, local advertising, which they view as more indicative of economic conditions than the national bulk advertisers, has surged, suggesting that businesses have become more confident and that the recovery is sustainable.  Conditions improved on the consumer side as well.  Delinquencies, which rose significantly last year, are falling and now are at or near what he described as close to normal levels.  What they call “churn”—that is, the number of people dropping their cable accounts relative to those signing up for cable—has also returned to more normal levels after deteriorating dramatically last year.  These are both very positive signs.  Of 44 of 146\f",
      "course, all of the news isn’t good.  This company usually spends $200 to $300 million a year building out cable services, mainly laying cable for new home construction.  As you might expect, those capital expenditures are way down, and they don’t anticipate those coming back until housing construction returns. The weakest signals in our District come from the labor markets.  Unemployment rates in our three states are at or near recession highs, and payroll employment has continued to decline over the last three months.  State and local budget situations are not rosy, and that, of course, is tied closely to employment, and that also remains a concern. On balance, the outlook for the region is for continued modest improvement.  The Philadelphia Fed’s leading economic indexes are projecting economic growth of around 2½ percent in our District for the next nine months or so.  The outlook among our business contacts has improved, but most are still expecting economic growth to be modest. At the national level, my outlook for the economy has changed very little since January.  I see a modest, but steady, recovery in economic activity that I believe will be sustainable even after the effects of monetary and fiscal policy wane. On the negative side, housing markets continue to be stressed, and the improvement in sales and starts seen earlier appears to have been driven by the tax credits.  It’s difficult to read precisely, because of bad weather, which also affects the numbers.  More broadly, I think that, given the distortions in the marketplace with programs like “cash-for-clunkers” or first-time homebuyers’ credits, it remains unclear how much of that spending that was taken out of the and services if consumers feel like spending.  So, although we may see a weakening in housing when the tax credit ends, we also may see a pickup in spending on automobiles and other things. 45 of 146\f",
      "Labor markets continue to be weak, but job losses appear to be bottoming out.  Businesses’ future hiring plans seem to be firming, and that’s indicated on our outlook surveys.  And I continue to expect a resumption in payroll growth in the second quarter.  This will be key to a continued improvement in household balance sheets and consumer spending.  The pickup in business investment and equipment that has been referred to is consistent with stronger business confidence.  The risk I see around my forecast for this year of around 3¼ to 3½ percent is roughly balanced.  My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Greenbook.  In the near term, I expect underlying inflation to remain very modest, but I do expect it to drift upward over the next several years, and I see upside risk to inflation in the medium to longer term. I continue to believe that we will need to begin tightening policy this year, certainly well before what is anticipated in the Greenbook, where there is no increase in the fed funds rate until 2012.  Sustained economic growth in the next coming quarter or two will be, to me, an important signal that we should begin normalizing policy.  So I would hope that in our April meeting we’ll be able to work towards a consensus on our longer-term operating framework, including our operating target.  Knowing, for example, that we will want to converge towards a corridor system will help us in our deliberations on the exit strategy to achieve our goal of dramatically reduced reserves and a portfolio that consists only of Treasuries.  With that, we will know better how to communicate those messages to the public.  Thus, I hope we can reach a decision on that goal soon.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n",

      "MR. WASCHER.  You’re right, and I think the answer is, we don’t really understand     why there’s such a difference.  Because they’re different surveys, there could just be   measurement differences in the two surveys.  The BLS tries to adjust the household survey to the    payroll concept.  But in this particular case, that doesn’t really help very much.  I think the other      possibility is that there tend to be cyclical patterns in the difference between household and     payroll employment.  When the economy is very weak, household employment tends to fall less  than payroll employment, and the reverse occurs in recoveries.  One possible explanation for that    is, in a weak economy, you may have a lot of people working off the books for a few hours a   week.  They report themselves as employed in the household survey, but they’re not really on   anybody’s payroll in a technical sense.  So they’re not picked up by the payroll survey.  It’s  possible that what’s going on over the past year or so is that, as the economy continues to    improve, you’re getting more people who are moving back into payroll jobs even though they  were already in jobs in the “informal” sector, if you will.  \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continued to improve during the intermeeting period, and the tone of our business contacts has   turned decidedly more optimistic.  It appears that the Third District’s economy is growing pretty   much at trend.  My staff’s state coincident indicators show moderate economic growth across the   tri-state area, and leading indicators point to continued growth over the next six months.  Regional manufacturing activity also continues to expand.  The Business Outlook   Survey’s general activity index posted its eighth consecutive monthly increase in January, rising      to 9.4, which again is about at trend level.  Six-month-ahead indicators in the survey are well into   positive territory, near their trend.  Manufacturers remain optimistic about future activity.  Firms    plan to increase capital expenditures over the next six months.  One very large business in our   District indicated that in 2013 it ended up expanding its capital expenditures well above what it      budgeted originally, and going forward it is now forecasting even more capital expenditures for  2014.  That business is much more optimistic in that regard.  Another manufacturer who   manufactures and sells products all over the world said that the end of 2013 was one of the  strongest periods it had witnessed in the past 10 years, and what it calls its “book” is very large,      forecasting—at least for the first eight or nine months of 2014—a very strong year.   The December employment report for New Jersey gained some headlines.  There was a  very sizable drop of 36,000 payroll jobs in New Jersey alone.  This is a 0.9 percentage point drop  on a monthly basis, not an annual basis, and the largest decline since September of 1945.   Pennsylvania also saw a decline in employment in December, but a more modest 0.2 percent.   Analysis by our staff suggests that a significant portion of this loss is very likely attributable to      poor weather conditions in the Northeast, as losses were concentrated in construction and in     leisure and hospitality, two sectors that have generally shown stable and growing employment in    82 of 192\f",
      " the region.  So I am inclined not to read too much into the December payroll numbers.  If we   average the monthly numbers and look at employment for the three months ending in December   over the comparable year-earlier levels, we see growth of about 0.7 percent in both states, which     is somewhat stronger actually than their longer-term trend.  Another positive indicator is that the    employment index in our manufacturing survey improved in January and is running above its   trend rate.  Taken altogether, my assessment is that labor market conditions in the District   continued to improve in the intermeeting period, and that they are likely to continue to do so   going forward into 2014.   Other activity in the District also firmed.  Commercial real estate activity is picking up.     There are three new major office projects breaking ground in center city Philadelphia, two 47-story mixed commercial and residential structures and one 59-story Comcast innovation center,    which will house a Four Seasons hotel as well as Comcast.  Net absorption of office space—the    difference between new space leased and space added—has been strong enough to drive down   vacancy rates over the past few quarters.  My read of conditions at the national level is pretty similar.  I have made little change in      my forecast.  While recent volatility in financial markets—including the emerging market    currency swings and equity price declines—could pose a risk if sustained, I have done little to    adjust my forecast to reflect that.  I think it is premature to do so, and I hope that we won’t have      to.  I continue to forecast economic growth at about trend.  My growth forecast for 2013, like  that of the St. Louis bank, was close to 3 percent.  It was a little high, but it turns out that the  fourth-quarter burst is going to bring it closer to that, and I continue to believe it will be about 3    percent going forward in 2014.  I haven’t changed that forecast, either.   83 of 192\f",
      "Inflation numbers have been low, but core inflation appears to be stabilizing.     Expectations are well anchored.  We can keep our fingers crossed.  For all the reasons that other     people have discussed, it is a bit of a wild card.    There seems to be accumulating evidence that the headwinds are not as strong as we   might have thought earlier.  The Tealbook has revised down its path for the unemployment rate  and reduced its measure of output gaps and labor market slack.  All but the nominal income    targeting rule point to a positive federal funds rate in the second quarter.  And note that this   includes or recognizes the fact that inflation is below target.  This suggests that we are likely    going to have to start pulling back on our policy accommodation sooner than we might have   once thought.  If so, we need to start thinking about how to best convey that message.  As we approach the 6½ percent threshold, and we continue to try to provide more accommodation through asset purchases, our communications will become more challenging, and we will have to    work on that. The alternative view in Tealbook A, which I applaud and I referenced earlier, makes a   plausible case that the economy has nearly recovered from the adverse shock of the Great   Recession and has returned to something that looks like steady-state growth.  But even if this is  not viewed as the modal forecast, I think it reconciles several conundrums in the data.  For   example, there have been several discussions around the table at recent meetings about the       unemployment once the participation rates return to trend.  The analysis by Shigeru Fujita on our   staff that I reported two meetings ago has largely been confirmed and reinforced by the Board   staff memo that came out during the intermeeting period.  That is to say that a large portion of     the participation rate decline is not cyclical—not all of it, but much of it is noncyclical.  This     84 of 192\f",
      "means that the drop in the unemployment rate, which is much sharper than many anticipated a   year ago, remains a pretty good indicator of labor market conditions.  I think it would be prudent for us to think about the implications of the alternative view for our policy choices going  forward—a topic that I will return to next go-around.   Before concluding, I’d like to say what an honor it has been, Mr. Chairman, to serve on   the FOMC with you.  Your leadership has been exemplary through some of the most troubling and challenging times in our nation’s economic history.  Of course, we will be making official   tributes to you tonight at dinner, but I didn’t want to let this opportunity go by without    acknowledging my personal deep gratitude for your service and your leadership.

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  I apologize for my inquisitiveness today, but I have two questions.   The first one is for David.  Your memo on the weather effect, line 5, basically says that it washes    out over the course of the year, which was basically my intuition.  So if people look at our SEP      median forecast and see real GDP is three-tenths lower in 2015 and four-tenths lower in 2016, do   you think they will assume that weather had no effect on that because it would have washed out    over the course of the year?  As you think about private-sector forecasts and your own forecast,   do you think it’s a standard assumption that it will all wash out over the course of a year?      My second question actually goes to the alternative scenario about emerging markets in    the Risks and Uncertainty section in the Tealbook A.  You have the financial crisis in the EMEs,     and the result is a leveling-off of the unemployment rate at 6½ percent.  What’s interesting about      this one stress is that it’s different from the others, which are getting more at plausible   differences that people might have in their baseline forecasts.  This is getting a little bit more at a   financial-stability type of stress, for which I commend you.  I think it’s a good one to be thinking      about.  But I do wonder if some of the financial spillovers are incorporated in the modeling that  you’re doing.  For example, European banks have a much larger exposure to emerging markets  than U.S. banks.  And so if they are having a stress test in Europe at the same time that this   emerging market financial crisis occurs, would you see more of a flow coming through Europe?   Would you pick up those secondary factors in the way that you’re doing the modeling?  \n",

      "MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to add to something I said yesterday  and explain why I walked through the stock and bond metrics as I did.  The bottom line is that, for those of us who are worried about putting the American people back to work, which is part of   our mandate, investment-grade corporate yields have been lower than the S&P’s forward-earnings yield.  And what that does is to provide an arbitrage opportunity, an incentive to    corporations to issue bonds and to use the proceeds to buy back shares—not to invest, as yet, robustly in job-creating cap-ex.  I think it’s important that we understand that dynamic.  That’s   the only reason I go into it in depth.  I’m quite sympathetic to Governor Stein’s sensitivity expressed yesterday.  But, in terms   of that particular sector of the financial markets—referring, in particular, to junk credits or  triple-Cs—you have to remember that the spreads are narrow over historically low nominal rates.   And all of these issues that I mentioned and Governor Stein mentioned and so on—I think the  key operative word in his intervention yesterday was “tiptoe.”  Like him, I was quite hawkish on  the upside—meaning I wasn’t in favor of QE3.  But, having been there, we have to be extremely   careful to tiptoe out of this room as we begin to change and provide forward guidance.  I continue to support the easy part, as President Pianalto mentioned, which is the   reduction in LSAPs.  In fact, I think it’s very important that, as we tiptoe out of that room, we not    push much faster than the measured rate at which we’re taking it—even though I respect     President Plosser enormously in terms of his suggestion.  We can take a look at that later, but, at    this juncture—and I realize he didn’t make the recommendation for now—but just to put it on   the table, I would not be in favor of going to more than $10 billion per month.  I like the way   we’re proceeding presently, even though, again, I was more hawkish on the other side.  But, like   Governor Stein, I think we have to be very careful here.   122 of 173\f",
      "In terms of tiptoeing—and remembering that we don’t have a whole lot of bullets left in    our holster—as you know, I recommended that we take out that second sentence in paragraph 6,   and I don’t expect us to do so at this meeting.  However, I think President Lockhart made the     most convincing argument there.  I want to have a little bit of ammunition in case things slip to     the downside.  Presently, as we put your imprimatur as Chair of this Committee on the statement,  without that paragraph, we’re taking a good first step.  It may be that, by including that sentence,   we take a step further than we need to take.  I don’t know.  In other words, I may want to put that    in my holster and save it, because I think President Lockhart made a very good point, which is, it    could help us later on should things slip to the downside.  I believe that was your point, President   Lockhart.  If you’re going to keep it the way it is, like everybody who has talked so far, whether  it was Governor Tarullo or the various presidents, I do think we need to change the “keeping  short-term interest rates” and reference the fed funds rate.  I was somewhat sympathetic to President Plosser’s comment on the word “current.”  But,    if you look at it from an expository writing standpoint, whatever we say is current.  Also, we say      “likely,” which is the conditionality in that sentence.  So I, like President Williams, could go   either way.  I am getting deeply worried, Madam Chair, that President Williams and I tend to  agree almost constantly now.  \n",

If we have a vibrant overnight reverse repo program, if money funds develop these special short-term safe   investment funds, and if they draw in funding on a large scale there, I’m assuming that, alternatively, those funds were going to go somewhere else.  Somebody else isn’t going to have a  fund available for that, and that fund is providing some funding for certain types of activities.     What types of activities are going to be diminished by this?  Is there a sense in which credit      intermediation to nonfinancial enterprises might be affected adversely?  I would hope not.  That  would be a big issue.  Is the shadow banking system going to somehow look smaller if we have   something like that?  Or will it be unchanged?

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m going to divide my comments into two parts.  The first part will be about how the exit strategy is related to the tactical issues discussed       in the staff memos, and the second part will be to walk through the questions posed and give my  perspective on those questions.   So let’s start with relation to the exit strategy.  As many of you know, I have advocated in    the past a different exit strategy than the one that is outlined in the Committee’s statement of exit     principles.  In particular, I have suggested that a LIFO exit strategy may be preferable for the  Committee.  LIFO means last in, first out.  I suggested that the Committee’s more controversial   and experimental policies could be reversed first, as they were attempts by the Committee to provide accommodation after the zero lower bound was encountered in December of 2008.  In   particular, the balance sheet should first be allowed to shrink, but at a carefully controlled pace,   and the pace of balance sheet reduction would become, for a time, the primary tool of the Committee, just as the pace of balance sheet expansion is at the present time.  Even before   revising the size of the balance sheet, LIFO would call for the reversal of the Operation Twist   program put in place by the Committee in 2011. The LIFO policy would have the great advantage that the Committee could take action to    remove accommodation without raising the policy rate.  The policy rate could stay much lower    for much longer.  At some point in the distant future, under a LIFO approach, the balance sheet   would approach a more normal size and further removal of accommodation would have to come   from increases in the policy rate.  However, with the balance sheet back to a normal size, the   Committee would then be able to resume targeting the federal funds rate, if it so desired, or it  could turn to targeting another short-term interest rate, such as the repo rate.  But the   96 of 267\f",
      "complications of trying to maintain the large balance sheet and still influence the federal funds   rate would be eliminated.  An open question, then, about what we’re talking about today, is what are we doing with   balance sheet policy as we are thinking about raising the fed funds rate?  Is the balance sheet  staying constant, or is it being reduced?  If it’s being reduced, isn’t that tightening policy?  If it’s        not tightening policy, then was balance sheet expansion not easing policy?  I think there are     some logical difficulties with some of what we’re thinking about here in trying to deal with the   policy rate issue separately from the balance sheet question.  The Committee may wish to     reconsider some aspects of the LIFO exit strategy in light of the discussion in the staff memos  concerning normalization of a large balance sheet.  In general, the LIFO exit strategy has much   to commend it in view of the many technical issues the Committee now faces in trying to    eventually raise the level of short-term nominal interest rates in the United States.  The logic of    first returning to our original pre-crisis, pre-unconventional policy situation before eventually  attempting policy rate liftoff seems quite compelling to me.    If we wish to remain with the current strategy, which calls for attempting to raise the  policy rate before any balance sheet reduction has been attempted, then the long list of questions   posed at the end of the first staff memo becomes relevant.  Let me now turn to those questions.      As a general remark, I think that the questions posed refer to issues that are of only second-order   importance relative to the principal macroeconomic issue, which is control or substantial    influence over short-term interest rates in the U.S. economy.  As the staff memo states,   “Policymakers can be confident that they will be able to raise money market rates when the time    to do so arrives, and that they will subsequently be able to exercise reasonable control over    97 of 267\f",
      "rates.”  There is, however, one issue that may be of first-order importance, which is the financial-stability question, and I will refer to this question in just a moment.     Let me turn to question 1:  Should the Committee continue to target the federal funds rate  during the period of normalization?  With a large balance sheet, I do not think the federal funds     rate is a practical option as a target policy rate.  The federal funds market is essentially     meaningless as it exists today.  Nor is it likely to gain economic meaning in the medium term.  I    see it as somewhat detrimental to the Committee’s credibility to claim that it is this particular  short-term nominal interest rate that we are most concerned about.  I have also been influenced     by the arguments that the Committee should try to influence a short-term nominal interest rate  with more economic meaning, such as repo, which is decided in a thicker market with many  more players trading.  I like the following analogy.  Suppose we are trying to influence the general price of fruit   by intervening in the market for apples.  One way to do this would be to buy apples from, or sell   apples to, a particular grocery store at a particular location in the country until the desired level  of general fruit prices was obtained.  Given the way economic theory works, in principle, by arbitrage this would work to achieve the objective.  But in practice, I think it would work much,    much better to trade apples with a wide variety of grocery stores across the country.  Something   similar is going on with repo rates versus the federal funds rate, and to some extent with respect  to the interest on excess reserves, which applies only to a limited set of institutions itself.    Question 2.  In shifting away from the federal funds rate, would you support the  development of a more robust measure of the overnight, unsecured bank funding rate to serve as a target?  I think that this may be a difficult road to go down.  Suppose we wanted to create an    index of three different rates.  If the three different rates move in lockstep due to a robust 98 of 267\f",
      "arbitrage environment, there would be nothing to gain from aggregating the three rates.  But if    the strength of arbitrage were variable among the three rates, then the changes in the strength of     arbitrage would show up as variability in the index, creating an undesirable barometer of the    stance of policy.  The index may move because the strength of arbitrage has changed and not   because the policy stance has changed.  For these reasons, I think that the creation of such an    index may be problematic. On the sub-question of “an administered rate versus a market rate,” my staff questioned   the meaning of these terms.  We should be thinking in terms of the policy rule associated with a   particular rate—that is, how the rate will be adjusted in reaction to economic developments—not  whether we can label a particular rule as a market rate or as an administered rate.  My staff said    that a Taylor rule is really an administered rate—or is it a market rate?—because you are setting    the target in reaction to developments in the economy, and that is informing the equilibrium of    the economy.  So they found this distinction to be moot.  Question 3.  Are you supportive of a fixed-rate, full-allotment, overnight RRP facility?    I’m generally supportive, although I’m anxious to hear the views of others on the Committee.  I  like the arguments about broader coverage, as I just mentioned.  I see the IOER as covering an   increasingly narrow segment of the U.S. financial intermediation sector, as President Fisher was talking about earlier today.  I will consider arguments about the appropriate spread, but in  general, I think the spread of zero would be a good place to start.  That would be option 1.  And  then we could use caps if we are concerned about the uptake issue.  I think if repo came to be   seen as the main focus of policy, FOMC communication would be sharp and effective.  There   would be little doubt in the markets about where the FOMC stands.   99 of 267\f",
      "Question 4.  How much of a divergence between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate   should be allowed?  I saw this as a second-order issue if the federal funds rate is not a      meaningful rate.  We should be thinking in terms of reducing focus on the federal funds rate.   Question 5.  Large net interest expense may be associated with some options.  How    comfortable are you with this?  I’m definitely not comfortable with the expense aspect of several       of the options.  I would like sharper estimates of these costs.  Because I am willing to simply sell    assets, if necessary, I question the idea of incurring substantial costs in order to be able to keep    the large balance sheet.  If it is expensive to keep the large balance sheet, why keep it?    Question 6.  If all approaches work equally well, which would you prefer?  If they all    work equally well, one differentiator between the various approaches may be the financial-  stability issue.  I have already mentioned that this is a first-order concern for the Committee.  I  certainly agree that we do not want to be encouraging or exacerbating financial instability  through the adoption of an operating regime during the normalization process for monetary   policy.  However, I see existing theories and ideas on this matter as insufficiently developed to   give us clear guidance as to whether a particular operating regime during the normalization   process is likely to enhance or reduce the probability of entering into a financial crisis in the   future.  In such theories, much would depend on other actions the Federal Reserve might take to   reduce the probability of a crisis or to mitigate a crisis once one develops, quite apart from the   choice of a temporary operating regime itself.  My judgment is that we should not make choices  on operating regimes based on the possible implications for financial stability, even though this   is a first-order concern for the Committee generally.  And finally, on question 7, additional testing.  In general, I am comfortable with   additional testing as suggested in the memos.  Thank you, Madam Chair.      100 of 267\n",

      "MR. LOCKHART.  In the late 1980s, total transaction EBIDTA multiples got to around  11, and with debt exceeding in many cases 9 times or 10, so that the equity slice in the deal was   less than 5 percent.  It’s another way of saying leveraged buyout folks were buying companies   almost totally with debt.  In response to the financial crisis, equity in deals went up to 40 percent   of the capital structure, and all I have heard is that they remain around 25 percent.  So you have    transactions that are valued at, say, 8 times multiple with 6 times debt.  That leaves quite a    significant amount of equity to burn through before you have a potential default.  That’s the   thrust of my question, and I just want to make sure we’re not misconstruing the danger   associated with slightly over 6 times debt multiples.  \n",

      "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The incoming data on the real economy    support the view that the first-quarter weakness in activity was largely transitory.  My business   contacts and directors are more upbeat than they have been in quite a while.  That’s in line with    my forecast expectations.  We’re still looking for economic growth to average 3 percent or so   over the remainder of the year.  By the June meeting, we should have a better sense of whether    the pickup in activity in the March numbers represents the beginning of a more solid and   sustainable step-up in growth or whether it’s just a transitory bounceback from the weather and    other factors that depressed January and February activity.  But, with what I know right now, I’m   feeling somewhat more confident about growth prospects than I did at our last meeting.  On the inflation front, I continue to be worried that inflation is much too low.  Perhaps   one could look at the past couple of quarters of core PCE inflation and say that the transitory  factors are behind us and inflation is running a bit higher, but the Tealbook’s estimate over the    past six months is still just 1.3 percent.  That’s really not much to get excited about.  A   1.3 percent run rate is still well below where inflation ought to be.   My business contacts continue to report no significant pricing pressures.  For example, at    a manufacturing roundtable we held a few weeks ago, no one talked about input cost increases.    The steelmakers were grousing about low prices.  Manufacturers didn’t seem worried about any   cost pressures in the pipeline, either.  Some of my auto contacts are concerned about softer     pricing.  They’ve seen a buildup in car inventories that’s holding down prices, and they tend to talk about the decline in the yen and the weakness in China as reasons to expect further downside  pressure on prices, both on autos and on overall pricing more generally.  Finally, no one expects any broad-based wage increases.  I guess this morning’s ECI was  in line with that thought, wasn’t it?  I only hear more of the same talk about shortages of certain    184 of 267\f",
      "kinds of skilled workers that we’ve been hearing for years, which have not shown through into  any meaningful pickup in aggregate measures of labor compensation.    In sum, I have not seen any developments since our March meeting that alter my thinking about the macroeconomic backdrop for our policy decision today.  We appear to be seeing a  welcome and long-overdue pickup in economic growth to a more solid pace—it’s always  unfortunate when we get that 0.1 percent, though, on the day that we have this meeting—but this   economic growth needs the continued support of highly accommodative policy in order to be  sustained.  And there’s nothing new on the inflation front to suggest we’re making anything  more than painfully slow progress, at best, back toward our inflation target.  Thank you, Madam   Chair.  \n",

      "MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My outlook, like everybody else’s, has not  changed much.  So, given that, I thought I would just mention a couple of data items that caught   my attention recently.  One is the housing market, and a number of you have already spoken about the housing     characterize the data on home sales—both new and existing as well as starts and permits—as   being weaker than expected, so quantity measures look soft.  At the same time, price measures look stronger.  The Tealbook, I think, characterizes CoreLogic and Case-Shiller as actually being  a little bit stronger than expected.  It’s interesting to try to make sense of that.  The natural  inference to draw is that at least some of the weakness on the quantity side is coming from    supply as opposed to demand.  President Lockhart mentioned a few of the specific factors, and I  think that feels reasonably compelling and worth thinking about.  At the same time, it’s also  good to remember that these price indexes are “baked up,” and they tend to have a bit of inertia   in them.  So, what the quantity data may be telling us is that we’ve got a little bit of softness in     prices yet to come.  I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on that.    The other thing—and this is an oddball thing—is that I saw this article in the Wall Street    Journal last week on the market for catastrophe bonds.  If you don’t know what catastrophe    bonds are, basically, you give your money over, and if no bad disaster happens—no tornado, hurricane, or earthquake—then a year later or three years later, you get all of your money back  with interest.  If there is one, then it’s like a default on your bonds—you lose your principal.      This market has seen a very big surge in issuance and a decline in yields, which was the Wall  Street Journal story.  I got interested in this.  Now, why in the world would you care about this   196 of 267\f",
      "market?  It’s a small market; it’s surely not systemic in any sense of the word.  It matters only if    you’re into nerdy identification stuff [laughter].  Think about the inference problem we face when we look at corporate bond spreads   narrowing.  Corporate bond spreads have been coming down, and we’re always saying, “Well, it    could be that risk premiums are going down, and returns to investors are going to be lower.”  But    it could be a strengthening economy—right?—with lower defaults in the period ahead.  The staff    does various things to try to tease these apart—for example, looking at short-term versus long- term credit spreads.  And there’s some notion that the short-term stuff is more default   informative.  I think about the beauty of catastrophe bonds.  The spreads on those are going to   narrow for one of two reasons—either risk appetite, broadly defined, or higher probability of a  disaster.  But as long as acts of God are not pro-cyclical, they’re totally uninformative about the   real economy—that you lose money when there’s a hurricane or something.  Here’s the idea:  If  you saw catastrophe bond yields and junk bond yields moving very closely together, the only   thing that these guys intersect on is the demand, the risk sentiment.  So a close co-movement of   those two would be an interesting clue about something. So I tried to get the data.  Now, there are data, and I didn’t do a very good job of finding  them.  I just found a handful of data points.  But, in the little bit that I saw, it was really quite      remarkable the extent to which, over the past two years, the yields on these bonds, which have   come down several hundred basis points, seem to be coming down very much in tandem with the  yields on corporate credit and others.  So I think one could get better data and do a little bit of a   study.  It seems to me that, as we struggle to try to do this identification, this might be a useful   little clue.

      "MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll make it unanimous and say that my  outlook has changed little since the last meeting, and it is, in fact, in line with the Tealbook’s.      With good intermeeting readings on retail sales, manufacturing, and consumer confidence, I see  economic growth rebounding to a level more consistent with the second half of last year.  And,  for the year, I see growth in the high 2 percent range.  In fact, at this point in the cycle, that starts    to feel pretty close to the speed limit to me.  I think we need consumption to continue to advance   at a decent clip just to produce overall economic growth in the high 2s.  Nothing that I see points  to a sudden acceleration of business or residential investment.  I expect them to increase but not   sharply.  Fiscal headwinds are going to continue to gradually wane, but there is no upside case   there lurking anywhere.  Net exports seem likely to continue to be roughly neutral overall and, in  the meantime, a highly volatile contributor, as we’ve seen in the past few quarters.  So I guess I  feel as though the upside case and the base case are in the high 2s, maybe 3 percent, for now.   Housing has become a significant disappointment.  Governor Stein and others have laid  out the basic narrative of longer-term expectations of a return to normal levels of household  formation, but, in the short-term, of weak activity and prices going up a lot, which does, of    course, suggest—and it makes sense—that there are somehow supply constraints.  I confess that    I find this still puzzling and somewhat unsatisfying.  And I worry that there are other longer-term  trends associated with poor job opportunities for younger people and lack of credit availability for weaker households.  I guess I would say that I find the price trend somewhat troubling, as it    is continuing in the face of weak demand.   The labor market report for February was in line with expectations of a return to decent  economic growth.  I would note that the labor force participation rate is now up 04 percentage    point since late last year.  I know there is some volatility there, but, holding all else equal, that 198 of 267\f",
      "bigger denominator would slow down progress in reducing headline unemployment but would,  nonetheless, be a very welcome development.  Along with nearly 3 percent economic growth, I  expect we’ll continue to see improvement in the labor markets and unemployment declining   nearly to 6 percent by year-end.  I also expect inflation to move back toward its 2 percent    objective.  Risk factors are the same as others have mentioned—principally, global factors  concerning China and Ukraine.  I would also add that I do see financial conditions as a potential      risk down the road.  The risk of continued rising froth in fixed-income markets, followed by a    correction that could halt progress, is a real one.  If this starts to have the feel of a classic credit      cycle, then the level of damage when the cycle turns is hard to predict.  It can be small, or it can be large.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  \n",

      "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m willing to support   alternative B at this meeting.  The FOMC adopted a new communications framework in its      believe that the Committee should strongly consider the kind of forward guidance described by President Rosengren in his recent speeches.  However, changing the forward guidance one  meeting after adopting a new communications framework would present challenges and raise questions about FOMC credibility.  So at this meeting, I’m willing to support alternative B.   In the remainder of my remarks, I’m going to pose three tactical questions about policy     that I think would be best for us to attempt to answer in our internal deliberations in the next    meeting or two.  My first question is, October versus December?  In our communication and internal deliberations, we have largely locked down the reduction in asset purchases to be $10 billion per meeting, barring large changes in the outlook.  That leaves one last, dangling   $5 billion to be the subject of fierce press attention.  Do we plan to zero that out in October or  wait until December? My second question is, how do we plan to implement and communicate our current, very   slow planned rate of increase for the fed funds rate?  The SEP suggested that, over the course of  2016, the federal funds rate will rise by considerably less than 25 basis points per meeting.  How,    exactly, do you prefer to implement that?  Will we raise the fed funds rate target by less than     25 basis points per meeting?  Now, of course, we might be changing the federal funds rate target,     as we discussed yesterday.  The concern I have about that is, even in normal times, having that degree of control over the fed funds rate might be challenging if we were trying to raise it by,  say, 10 basis points a meeting.  From the conversation we had yesterday, I came away feeling   that that might be even more of an issue as we exit this time around.  Another approach would be   222 of 267\f",
      "to be chunky—that is, move at some meetings and not others, let’s say at press conference   meetings.  But that has other challenges associated with it.  I’m not saying this is an impossible problem, by any means.  It’s more that we should be thinking ahead about the choice we prefer   so that we can develop appropriate communication plans and, if necessary, enhance our technical  ability to move whatever target rate we want in smaller-than-usual increments.  As I suggested yesterday—and I like what President Plosser said here, too—we should  also be planning for the contingency—I view this as remote—that we might want to raise our   target interest rate very rapidly.  Some of the learning by doing might have to be in a very  compressed time frame if that turns out to be true.   My third question just follows up on remarks the Vice Chairman made yesterday and  Presidents Plosser and George have made today.  There remains uncertainty in the markets about   our reinvestment policy.  I’ve heard about it as well.  So I think it would be useful for us to have   a conversation about that and try to achieve that.   The three questions, to go over them again, are as follows:  October or December?  How  are we actually going to achieve our projected slow pace of interest rate increases?  And what’s       going to be our policy about stopping reinvestments?  I think that, for all of these questions,   there’s a temptation to use a “we’ll figure it out when we get there” approach, but my experience     on the FOMC is that we get better policy outcomes when we plan proactively for the future.  For   example, I thought, Madam Chair, the process we used to get to the communications framework  that was announced in March—while I didn’t agree with where we ended up—was exactly the right one.  Planning for the future and communicating plans, when we formulate them, to the  public help households and businesses form more precise expectations and reduce policy   uncertainty, which is a benefit in its own right.  So I’d hope we can resolve these uncertainties in   223 of 267\f",

We could use the FSOC—if they     designate a firm a systemically important nonbank institution, that could be one metric for doing    that. On the government funds—if you go to the chart which shows you that most of the take- up has been from the government money funds, and given that we have somewhere between 50   and 60 percent of the assets under management in the government money fund industry, I think  if we wanted to exclude the prime funds, we could certainly do that.  One of the things that is   true is prime funds can invest in government-only funds.  So just excluding the prime funds   doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t have pretty quick access through the family of funds they’re    in to the overnight RRP. \n",

And then our decisions were viewed  as containing information about our reaction function, about how hawkish or dovish this    Committee is.  And so that’s a cost of retaining flexibility—that your decisions are not viewed as    being necessarily conditional on economic outcomes, but rather on the makeup and the  inclinations of the Committee.  My own view of the events of 2013 is that we weren’t    sufficiently clear in September 2012, and that’s what led to the challenges.

      "MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The discussion so far has been useful and   illuminating.  There are many complexities and subtleties, and when presented with a number of   tradeoffs in which the choice isn’t clear-cut, my approach is to pose some framing questions or    tests as a way to sort through the options.    My tests are, first, the probability of achieving control over short-term rates; second,  where feasible, some flexibility to allow tactical adaptation as we learn; and, third, simplicity and    clarity of communications.  When I go through the questions I will reorder them a little bit and  bunch some together.   On the question of the emphasis on the federal funds rate or administered rates, first, I    expect we’re going to settle on using alternate rates for both monetary control and  communications purposes, and I think it’s worth trying to preserve in that construct the use of the     fed funds rate.  I favor beginning with a target range for the federal funds rate, since it is now  familiar and probably more workable in the early stages.  So I favor the second of the two     options presented in the staff memo.  I see it as giving us the best chance of exerting control over      short-term rates.  If we go this way, a first order of business will be to construct statements that     are as clear as possible, given all the moving parts.  I think the 3' verbiage in the illustrative time          of liftoff statement would meet the test of clarity and simplicity.  Now I’ll go to question 4, and that is the question about publishing an expanded fed  funds rate definition.  I’m open to an expanded federal funds rate, including an expansion that  incorporates Eurodollar transactions, along with nonbrokered fed funds transactions.  At the  same time I think we should aim for the most durable definition possible of the target funds rate,   and that leads me to thinking that we should include in our planning the scenario in which we    return to a balance sheet of a size at which reserves are relatively scarce.  So I don’t know if     91 of 302\f",
      "including Eurodollar transactions presents any issue in such a scenario, and this is the kind of  question I think we can sort out in coming deliberations.   On question 2, about circuit breakers—I thought the staff took a mostly neutral position  in the presentation of options in the memos, but on this question I thought the staff went pretty   far in pushing a cap on aggregate usage paired with a uniform-price auction mechanism.  I think this is a sensible place to start.  Although this is perhaps not a decisive consideration, this   approach strikes me as simpler and less problematic to implement in terms of IT systems   adjustments, as was pointed out in the memo.  Some of my other duties in the System make me     attentive to such a statement.  I’d like to spend more time on this question of limits and circuit    breakers leading up to the July decision point, and I hope we can ask follow-up questions of the  staff during the period before the next meeting.  The third question, which I’ll treat as the last one, is the reinvestment question—ceasing  reinvestments or taking a graduated approach.  Ending reinvestments simultaneously or   coincident with liftoff is clearest and conveys greater conviction, but I’m open to doing it after    liftoff because I think this buys some time to observe how the first phase of tightening goes.  I   think the reinvestment program can be ended or wound down based on tactical considerations  after the transition represented by liftoff has been accomplished.  This, I think, is an area in    which tactical flexibility is feasible.  Thank you, Madam Chair.    \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It’s probably appropriate for     me to begin with the issue of reinvestment.  As I noted in a speech last month, I think there are     some compelling reasons for ending reinvestments sometime after liftoff of short-term rates  rather than before or coincident with liftoff.  In my mind, ending reinvestments later, after liftoff, serves four purposes.  First, it   lessens the risk of foreshortening the entire tightening process.  If we were to end reinvestments    before liftoff, then the end of reinvestments would be viewed as the beginning of the tightening process.  That runs the risk of both raising long-term rates, especially to the extent that people   emphasize flows rather than stocks, and also raising the expected trajectory of short-term rates   because it would pull forward people’s expectations in terms of the probability of liftoff, and the    timing of liftoff would be pulled forward in time.  Thus, I think ending reinvestments first could   lead to a significant tightening of financial conditions that might be more than we desire or   anticipate.  That could disrupt the economic expansion, and that could actually delay the liftoff   of short-term interest rates.  Similarly, if we end reinvestment and commence liftoff together, the   effect could be greater than we anticipate, and if it was greater than we desired, it might be     awkward, if we’re doing both together, to then reverse course.  I also think separating the two   Second, because ending reinvestments first could conceivably delay liftoff in certain   states of the world, it is inconsistent with our goal of getting off the zero lower bound as soon as    possible in order to regain monetary policy flexibility.  It seems to me that getting off the zero       lower bound as soon as possible, consistent with our dual-mandate objectives, should be a goal of policy, as that would provide greater flexibility in terms of responding to future shocks. 107 of 302\f",
      "Third, I think delaying the end of reinvestments also should simplify our communications   as we lift off.  There will be one moving part—short-term interest rates—rather than two.  Also,   if we’re adjusting both short-term rates and the size of the balance sheet at the same time, I think   it would be more difficult for us to assess what the particular effect is of each instrument.    And, fourth, ending reinvestments later also strikes me as a better risk-management  strategy.  Let’s compare two scenarios:  reinvestments end before liftoff versus the end of    reinvestments is delayed until after liftoff.  Now, assume that, in these two scenarios, the      economy subsequently disappoints.  In the first case, when we end reinvestments first, we might   have to reverse course.  In the second case, ending reinvestments later, disappointment about the   outlook would cause expectations about the end of reinvestments to be pushed out.  That would  keep the balance sheet larger for longer, and that would act as an automatic stabilizer in terms of    supporting economic activity, which I think would be desirable. In terms of how to specify the end of reinvestments, my original thinking was maybe to      specify a level of interest rates as a threshold or a trigger, but after talking to the Vice     Chairman—not myself, but Stan—I concluded that retaining some flexibility was a better    approach.  So I would favor general language to the effect that reinvestment is expected to continue until short-term interest rates are raised significantly above zero and the FOMC is     significantly closer to meeting its dual-mandate objectives.  I’m not wedded to any particular     language, but I think keeping it relatively vague so we have some flexibility makes more sense.   So, Stan, you did convince me. In terms of ending reinvestments all at once or more gradually, I think that depends on   timing and circumstances.  If you were to adjust reinvestment in 2015, you probably would end it   outright because the amount of maturing agency MBS is pretty modest, about $20 billion per   108 of 302\f",
      "month.  But if the end of reinvestment doesn’t occur until 2016, then you’re talking about a  much bigger end, and so in that case you might want to taper it because you’re not really sure    what such a large end might mean.  I also think the particular circumstances of the economy at   the time would be very important.  So I don’t think we have to really foreshadow exactly how we   would do it at this point in time.    The second issue I want to focus on is the federal funds rate.  Here I have a strong   preference for revamping how we calculate the effective funds rate, adding the overnight  Eurodollar borrowing as part of the calculation, and I want to substitute this new methodology   for the current effective federal funds rate rather than having a new rate and an old rate.  I favor   moving to a single improved rate.    As Governor Powell has pointed out, moving to a single improved rate helps us    considerably with the federal funds rate as a reference rate.  If we make the switch, then we have  a rate that’s more robust that trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts reference.  If we keep the        old rate and have a new rate, we still have this problem that we have all of these derivative   contracts referencing this old, infirm rate.  I think we found with LIBOR that there’s a        tremendous amount of inertia.  Everyone knows LIBOR is a troubled reference rate, yet people   are still using LIBOR in all of their derivatives contracts.  So I would prefer to avoid the problem   of forcing the transition to the new reference rate by just actually giving people an improved  reference rate, and then it happens simultaneously and we’re done with that problem.    I view the benefits of forcing the switch as large, relative to the risks of contract   frustration.  My reading is that the contract frustration risks are very low because most contracts      simply say the effective federal funds rate is what the Federal Reserve says the effective federal  funds rate is.  And, second, in terms of the substance, the new rate will be very close.  Over the    109 of 302\f",
      "past four years, it averages less than 1 basis point difference from the old federal funds rate.  So  both in terms of the legal reading but also in terms of the difference in the two rates, it seems like    just moving to the new rate makes the most sense.  With respect to the issue that changing to the new rate will make it hard down the road to   move back to the old definition of the federal funds rate—I heard people express that as a   concern once our balance sheet normalizes—I think this exaggerates the degree of difficulty of   going back to the old federal funds rate sometime in the future.  If the federal funds rate market   deepens again as our balance sheet normalizes, I think it wouldn’t be that hard to move back to    the old definition and just explain that we’re now moving back to the old definition because the   funds market is much deeper now.  It’s a much better reference rate.  It’s much less idiosyncratic.   And so we’re moving back for those reasons.  I don’t think that constrains us very much.  The third issue I want to discuss is the issue of our target.  My own view is that we   should be targeting the general level of money market rates rather than the federal funds rate.       The federal funds rate has gotten pretty idiosyncratic.  I’m with Governor Fischer on this—why   are we holding onto this thing as a vestige of times past when what we really care about in terms  of setting monetary policy is setting the general level of money market rates to actually influence    financial market conditions?  So I would prefer to emphasize the general level of money market   rates—and we could keep the federal funds rate around, you know, we don’t have to throw it out,    but I would emphasize general money market rates.  I think I’d prefer that over actually  emphasizing the IOER rate or the overnight RRP rate, because those are administered rates.   One thing I do want to avoid, though, is having the Desk try to pin the federal funds rate  to a particular level and moving the overnight RRP and IOER rates around on a day-to-day basis.    I don’t really see the benefit, in terms of affecting financial conditions, of small movements of    110 of 302\f",
      "these administered rates just to try to pin the federal funds rate to a particular rate.  I think that    what we really have to emphasize here is the control of financial market conditions, and so the    simplest regime that generates good control of financial market conditions is what I’m for.  So that means a range for general money market rates, and as long as the rates stay within that   range, then I wouldn’t see that you’d need to adjust the administered rates except when you’re    trying to implement a policy change. The fourth issue is with respect to caps on the overnight RRP facility.  I think the staff  made it very clear there are lots of ways to do it.  My emphasis would be on having caps that do   not bind in peacetime, or noncrisis periods, but bind in wartime—crisis periods when we want to  limit the inflow into the overnight RRP facility, to limit the upward spikes in riskier money    than overengineered in a way that creates unnecessary frictions in peacetime just to be slightly    better in wartime situations that might never occur.  I think we’re overemphasizing, a little bit, the risk of this future financial crisis, and I  don’t want to design a very complex mechanism that only is relevant on one day out of    1,000 days.  It just seems sort of backward.  In my mind, an ideal regime would have no caps in  peacetime, except for a high overall limit that you would never expect to reach, and then in    wartime a system of caps that was automatically triggered by market conditions when stress   conditions developed.  In other words, what I’d prefer to have is an arrangement in which the caps automatically get triggered by a spread in interest rates.  So if the spread between risky rates and risk-free rates    widens, the caps automatically come into place.  Now, I know the staff hasn’t proposed this.  It’s   probably too complicated to be easily realized.  You’d always have the risk that you might not be  111 of 302\f",
      "sure that the caps would be forthcoming in all circumstances.  I would encourage the staff to  consider whether a regime like this was feasible, but I’m going to confine my remaining   comments to the construct as outlined in the staff memo.    I would generally be pretty indifferent between individual caps and aggregate caps.  It  seems like the staff nailed the distinction.  Individual caps have the benefit of certainty for the   investor.  The aggregate caps have the value that you get the pooling advantage, and so they’re       more efficient in that sense.  I get the sense from reading the staff’s report that they lean in the      direction of aggregate caps.  I certainly get a sense around the table that we as a collective group   lean in favor of aggregate caps.  So I’m perfectly happy to go with the sense of the Committee  and go with an aggregate cap.  Finally, I have just a few thoughts on the whole issue of the overnight RRP facility,  which has gotten a lot of comments today.  I think the consensus around the table, as I hear it, is   that we want to use the overnight RRP facility to establish a floor on rates to enhance our     credibility in terms of monetary policy control, but we want to keep it pretty small in terms of its   footprint in the market.  And so that implies that we’re going to have to keep the spread    relatively wide to limit take-up.  My view is that a spread of 20 or even 30 basis points would   probably be effective in terms of setting a floor and maintaining monetary policy control.  I think  if we did that we could be pretty comfortable that we weren’t going to get a facility that was  large in some sense.  I don’t view, in the context of the U.S. financial system, a facility that is      $200 billion or $300 billion as large.  I don’t know what the total amount of financial assets   outstanding in the United States is, but it’s probably $60 trillion.  So if you had a facility that was   $200 billion, I think that would be not large but pretty trivial in the context of the U.S. economy.   112 of 302\f",
      "Also, I think we should make no commitment to making it permanent, but I would prefer   not to make a commitment to making it temporary, either.  I would just keep it open.  I think  we’re going to learn by having this facility in place, and maybe it will work better, in more  miraculous ways, than we anticipate, or maybe it will work worse, and I don’t think anything we say today is really going to bind future Committees.  And so I think I’d keep it open and not lean  one way or the other in terms of what’s going to happen over the longer term.  Thank you,   Madam Chair.  \n",

      "MR. FISCHER.  Thanks very much, Madam Chair.  We all benefited from the excellent  staff work and preparation of papers.  I benefited even more than most of you, because I was   force fed [laughter] this diet of papers, and it was very, very helpful.  I almost understand some   of the issues now. I was required to read the transcript of last time’s discussion, and it was impressive,   actually.  It was very serious.  It was even interesting.  [Laughter]  And I thought it was at a high    level.  I thought the staff uncharacteristically made a mistake in this list of five possibilities,    because when there are three you know which one to go for.  This time you had to choose    between three in the middle, options 2, 3, and 4.  It couldn’t possibly be 1 or 5.  So we got to   options 2 and 3, and options 2 and 3 barely differ.  In option 2, the policy rate is a market or  administered rate.  I think it should say “or rates.”  And in option 3, the federal funds rate is how  you describe the policy.  I’m not sure that it’s a policy rate, but we’ll come to that in a minute.      Now, as I first heard about this, I thought what we had was a corridor system in which the   IOER rate was the top of the corridor and the ON RRP rate was the bottom of the corridor.  But,  if so, it’s a very complex one, because in most corridor systems the upper rate is the borrowing    rate from the central bank and the lower rate is the deposit rate at the central bank.  And here the  upper rate is the deposit rate—  [Laughter]  This almost sounds like the difference between  Britain and the United States—up is down and down is up, and things like that, on most issues.    But the difference arises primarily from the fact that the U.S. banks are not currently   active in the federal funds market.  At least that’s how I understand this issue.  And that really  brings us to an issue that bothers a lot of people, including me, and that issue—it was put too      strongly as, is it our job to enable nonbanks to indirectly receive interest payments from the Fed?   And while President Kocherlakota raised very valid issues, I think the answer is, it would be  132 of 302\f",
      "preferable if that didn’t happen and we didn’t have to go to the Congress for a discussion on this   issue, which would probably end up with us getting a triple mandate or something else.  You don’t go to the Congress lightly, in any case.  It does seem to me really problematic that we  would be spreading seigniorage much more widely than we want to, and we need to think about    that. Before I answer the questions, I just want to raise three issues.  First of all, how confident     are we that we can run this system smoothly and successfully?  Who was on the other side—this   is a question for Simon and the people on the Desk—who was on the other side of the reverse  repos all the time?  Was it American money market funds?  Was it European banks, as I was  originally told?  Who was it, and how robust is the behavior of this system?  Second, a related question:  A lot of people have been in favor of the IOER-only  system—don’t bother with the ON RRP program, and just hope that the federal funds rate would   trade close to the IOER rate.  I think that might happen when there are very few reserves in the   system, but it probably wouldn’t happen right now.  But it would be interesting if we could have  from the staff their view on whether there is any prospect of such a system succeeding.  If so, it   would deal with a lot of problems that some people have with using the federal funds rate.   The third issue—and this is one that bothers me more generally, but it applies also in this     context—is that I am much less fond of trying to fix a deterministic path for what we are going    to do two or three years down the road.  I don’t think we know.  We can say what we think today   we are going to do two or three years down the road.  But if I look back at the 2011 exit-strategy principles, they are all about the federal funds rate.  Well, now we are considering whether to  make that the way we do monetary policy.  And if we watch what happened to the British with their forward guidance, which didn’t hold up, I don’t see that they have suffered a huge loss in  133 of 302\f",
      "credibility as of now, but that may have to do with the fact that the person who changed it wasn’t   the person who said it.  And it may be more complicated for us.  So I would prefer to retain some   more flexibility, and I’ll come to that in a moment.    Let me try to answer these questions.  The first one is, during normalization, do you want  to communicate the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate or by     emphasizing administered rates?  Well, I would like to do it by targeting the federal funds rate.  As Bill English said, that system seemed to work fairly well.  But it doesn’t seem to be   something we could do right now.  We would have to go to at least the IOER rate and, I think,  the overnight reverse repo rate.    By the way, I have a suggestion that President Lockhart would like.  ON-blank-RRP is a   very long name for something.  I think if you wrote “ONRRP,” without a blank, you would save     paper [laughter] and you’d save ink.  I’m not volunteering to join your committee, but may I    propose that as a possibility?  If we continue to target the federal funds rate—well, that’s one possibility—should it be a    point target or a target range?  From what I understand now, if we made it a point target, we’d      miss it significantly.  If we wouldn’t, then I don’t know why we’re not doing it now and why we  don’t just go with that.  Everything I’ve read suggests we would have trouble hitting it, so I think   a target range would be preferable.  If we communicate the stance of policy using the overnight RRP and IOER rates, we   should, I think, refer to the federal funds rate for the reason that the public knows about it.  It has   the attraction that as we get to a much smaller size of the balance sheet, we could probably run this system operating via the banks, and we’d solve the issue of spreading the seigniorage around   too widely. 134 of 302\f",
      "In terms of the circuit breakers, you don’t want those to be so tough that you can’t act as     lender of last resort in a crisis.  And we’re all thinking that everybody wants to pour their money   into the United States.  It has happened that everybody wanted to get their money out of here    sometimes.  And we have really got to think about keeping those caps flexible because they are   caps on what we can do with our portfolio.  I think we need to retain that flexibility, and that   would certainly involve interest rate movements, and we’d have to be ready to move interest    rates. Should there be limits on the size of the overnight program?  Yes, because if we got close    to the size of the portfolio, we’d be well into an area in which we would be operating with no   knowledge of how the system would work, and we really need a constraint on allowing ourselves  to get anywhere close to that point.  On the reinvestment of principal, when I wrote this the other day, I said, “By the way,   what is the circumstance under which we would run off the size of the portfolio before raising  the short rate?”  Having listened to the discussion, I think we shouldn’t, and that we should raise  the rate first and then start thinking about the size of the portfolio.  I don’t know that we should try to fix a date for that.  I think we need to retain flexibility,   both on the composition of the portfolio and on the timing of beginning to run it off.  And on the   composition, somebody already mentioned the real estate problem.  Real estate is much weaker    now than we thought it would be, and I expect it is going to straighten out.  If it doesn’t  straighten out, I don’t think we want to be selling off MBS at the time that we have decided we should be beginning to reduce the size of the portfolio.  A final thought—if the Fed constructs this index of the federal funds rate and the  Eurodollar rate, then we have really got ourselves into a case in which we’re targeting a rate     135 of 302\f",
      "which we don’t have a heck of a lot of influence over, and we’re relying on the market keeping    them together.  Sometimes those arbitrages work, and then sometimes some strange thing happens and they break.  So I think we should say we target a measure like that, but I would prefer to actually publish the federal funds rate.  I think the Eurodollar rate is pretty far from us.  It looks like it has been tight for quite a while, but it doesn’t feel to me, given all the things that   influence Eurodollars, that we can rely on that.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  \n",

The idea is that the      Stock-Watson model sees most shocks nowadays to inflation as basically transitory shocks that  are reversed very quickly, and so it would probably pass through some of that and reverse some  of the shock pretty quickly.

As to the sanctity of 2 percent, if the Committee were, for whatever reason, to announce that your  objective had been revised from 2 to 2½ percent, one could introspect about what the effects of  that would be.  A consequence and implication, a corollary of the perspective that we’ve taken, is   that you might not get all of the way from, say, 2 to 2½ just on the basis of words alone, and that you might need to back that up with some actual behavior.  That’s the basic proposition.  Now, if   one takes the view that, through communication alone, you could get wage and price setters, who   are actual flesh-and-blood people engaged in the acts of setting wages and prices, to conform  their behavior to your announcement without running the economy a little hotter for a period of    time, then you could take the view that 2 percent itself is a natural attractor.  That informs my  judgment that it’s entirely plausible for inflation expectations right now to be anchored at   something that’s just a little different from what the Committee has in mind as its objective.     \n",

      "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The basic contours of my outlook have not    changed much since April.  Like almost everyone else, we expect a bounce back in the second  quarter, followed by growth somewhat above 3 percent in the second half.  This trajectory seems   consistent with the reports from my directors and other business interlocutors.  Basically, the    reports continue to be positive, though not bubbling over with enthusiasm.  In general, businesses are expecting healthy gains in sales and production over the   remainder of the year.  According to some, these higher sales should spill over into some higher   investment as well.  For example, at a recent manufacturing roundtable in Chicago, there was   increased talk of stronger capital expansion plans.  Roundtable participants primarily represent    small and medium-sized manufacturers.  Most of the firms planning to build additional capacity  had close ties to the auto industry or energy-related infrastructure.    Our private equity and insurance contacts also were relatively optimistic about the    prospects for the nonfinancial companies and their portfolios.  Notably, one mentioned that they   are starting to see earnings coming from growth in top-line revenues as opposed to aggressive  cost cutting. Although my contacts generally were optimistic, no one was expecting a breakout in    activity as we move through the year.  Indeed, for me, it continues to be much easier to list  downside risks to the outlook than to list upside propellants.  For example, the likely large downward revision to first-quarter consumer spending based on the quarterly census service-sector data and the ho-hum retail sales report for May suggest that the momentum in household  spending may not be quite as strong as we’ve assumed.  Downside risks to housing remain,  particularly as credit conditions still appear to be restrictive.  And the global economy continues    180 of 302\f",
      "to face strong challenges, so there’s also reason to be cautious about international growth.   Nevertheless, I expect growth over the next 18 months to be around a 3 percent pace. Turning to inflation, recent data have moved year-over-year rates off their lows.  This is a welcome development, but, even with today’s CPI data, I don’t see it as a sure sign that inflation    is headed back to target at a reasonable pace.  First, I haven’t increased my 2014 inflation  projection since the March SEP.  I had 1½ percent then, and I still do.  The only difference is that   in March, it was mostly a hope that we would get there.  Now it’s in one month’s data.  This is a     good development but not a reason to raise my forecast.  Second, all of our analytics in Chicago continue to point to below-target inflation over     the medium term.  Our affine term structure model with inflation factors continues to see three-     year-ahead inflation expectations below 2 percent this year and over the next four years—that is,   through 2018, three years ahead.  We’ve done a lot of work over the past year on our Chicago    Fed DSGE model.  It now has more robust and reasonable inflation dynamics, and these result in    an inflation projection that remains below 2 percent for the next several years.  My business  contacts also show little worry about inflation.  They consistently note a lack of cost pressures  either from wages or from materials or other inputs.  Indeed, the weak wage growth we continue      to see certainly is an important sign of low inflationary pressures.  Third, there is the notable Deb Lindner Board memo on the role of inflation expectations   in the Tealbook forecast.  That analysis suggests inflation will likely stabilize below our  2 percent target unless something else happens.  Now, I have to take note of the fact that at some  point in the discussion about this, someone said, “But inflation has been 2 percent for a number  of years.”  That led me to look up the Tealbook data on that.  If you look at total PCE inflation, in 2008, it was 1.5 percent.  In 2009, it was 1.2 percent.  In 2010, it was 1.3 percent.  It was  181 of 302\f",
      "2.6 percent in 2011, but then it was 1.7 percent in 2012, and, in 2013, it was 1.0 percent.  Inflation has been low. So, what could that something else be that gets us back to target?  It could be some lucky  break, or it could be something within our control, such as strong communications that the  FOMC intends to get inflation back up to target quickly and is willing to overshoot in order to    achieve our stated dual-mandate goals within a reasonable period of time.  Personally, I’d rather  bank on that than on luck. In sum, my thinking about the macroeconomic backdrop for our policy decision tomorrow is about the same as it was in April.  We appear to be seeing a welcome and long-    overdue pickup in growth to a more solid pace, but this growth needs the continued support of   highly accommodative policy in order to be sustained.  And, while the recent inflation news has   been in the right direction, it still appears that we’re making only slow progress back toward our  inflation target.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  \n",

      "MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Tenth District economy continued to   expand moderately since our last meeting.  District employment picked up slightly in April, and four of our seven District states now have unemployment rates at or below their pre-recession   average.  Service and manufacturing firms both reported stronger activity in May and remained  optimistic about employment growth in coming months.  And, finally, drilling activity in the  Tenth District increased further in May, driven by a rise in crude oil activity.    Turning to the national economy, my outlook for real growth is little changed compared  with our last meeting.  Like others, I expect a rebound in the second quarter from the decline we      saw in the first quarter, and I have lowered the path of the unemployment rate through the end of   2015.  Looking ahead, I continue to expect above-trend growth of around 3 percent over the   forecast horizon.  The fundamental factors supporting this forecast are fiscal drag ending, labor     supportive of growth.  The most recent NFIB survey is consistent with my view of a gradual  pickup in economic activity and inflation.  Small business optimism and the percentage of small businesses expecting higher real sales in the next six months are at or tied with their post- recession highs.  In terms of labor markets, the composite labor market indicators constructed by my staff    continue to show improvement in the level of labor market activity, and the momentum indicator   of this survey is higher than at any time in the past two decades.  Key factors contributing to the  high level of momentum are the growth in aggregate weekly hours and improvement in the    University of Michigan’s measure of expected job availability.  I’m also encouraged by the  increase in the job-finding rate for the short-term unemployed—which increased from 22 percent   190 of 302\f",
      "in January to more than 29 percent in May, a post-recession high—as well as the significant  increase in job openings in the latest JOLTS data.    In terms of housing, one of my District contacts, who is a CEO of a large national realty     firm, characterized the housing market as settling into a more traditional and sustainable growth  pattern, even as she described a confluence of factors that currently affect the market.  Low    inventories, tight lending standards, elevated levels of student loan debt for first-time    homebuyers, and a lack of new building were cited as weighing on housing.  And she noted that  much of the available inventory is of rather low quality.  The declining share of first-time    homebuyers in the market was also cited as a substantial headwind.  Similar to President  Plosser’s observation, work by my staff has highlighted that the aging population will continue   to substantially shift demand from single-family units toward multifamily.    In the face of these issues, of course, housing remains extremely affordable by historic  measures.  I noted that the National Association of Realtors’ Housing Affordability Index shows  that housing is still substantially more affordable today than at any time between 1970 and 2009.   In addition, I’m encouraged that the employment-to-population ratio for 16-to-24 year-olds has  been picking up over the past 12 months, which may help foster demand for first-time buyers.  So, even as housing continues to face headwinds, I expect historic affordability and an improving    labor market to lead to continued, though modest, gains over the forecast horizon.  Finally, turning to inflation, recent data releases show that the deceleration we saw last  year has ended, and we’re seeing a broad-based increase in inflation over the past few months.     The NFIB survey also reports that the percentage of respondents planning on raising their    average selling prices and worker compensation is at or near its post-recession high.  This gives   191 of 302\f",

      "CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard?  [No audible response]  Okay.    Well, I want to thank you for a very interesting set of observations on the economic outlook.  At  our previous meetings I summarized some of your comments during the go-round by relating    them to a few key questions that underpin our policy decisions, and with your indulgence I will  employ the same approach today, relying, in fact, on questions that are close cousins to those I   posed last time.  The questions are the ones that we’ve established to continue tapering our asset    purchases, namely, is the labor market continuing to improve and is progress likely to be  sustainable; and second, is it reasonable to expect that inflation will return to our 2 percent    objective over time?  On the question of labor market improvement, I heard broad agreement around the table   that the labor market is continuing to improve.  A number of you, including Presidents Fisher,    Plosser, and Bullard, mentioned positive labor market developments in your own regions, and of   course, the employment reports for April and May showed solid job gains nationally with the  three-month averages of both total and private payroll gains now standing about 230,000 per  month, which is up from about 180,000 in March.  President George and several others mentioned a wide set of labor market indicators and   various indexes that you’ve constructed; the ones similar to the Board’s labor market index   likewise suggest improvement.  The U-5 and U-6 are down, job openings up, the rates of hiring    and quits, while still below normal levels, are gradually moving up.  The prevalence of hard-to- fill jobs is rising.  Household surveys suggest some improvement in confidence in the labor     coming down. 210 of 302\f",
      "Of course, along with the decline in the unemployment rate, we have also seen a  significant decline in the labor force participant rate, and Tealbook interprets part of that decline   as cyclical.  It does not interpret the full decline in U-3 as reflective of reduction in labor market      slack.  Several of you, including Vice Chairman Dudley, noted that you agree with this  interpretation, but I did hear some skepticism around the table about this conclusion, and   Presidents Plosser and Bullard both suggested that we may not, in fact, see any significant   bounceback in participation.  Indeed, conceivably, the decline is related to the structural   phenomenon that President Fisher mentioned yesterday, namely, the disappearance of middle- class jobs.  I think the evidence does suggest that a disproportionate share of job loss during the      recession came in middle-paying occupations, whereas the gains since then have been tilted   somewhat toward lower-paying occupations.  On the topic of how far we remain from our maximum employment goal, this is    something we will surely be debating in the coming months.  A number of you—including  Presidents Rosengren and Lockhart, who mentioned this explicitly—see notably more slack than    would be indicated by U-3 alone.  This reflects the fact that an unusually large share of the work   force is involuntarily underemployed, as well as the unusually large decline we’ve seen in labor  force participation, a portion of which arguably reflects cyclical factors.  These forms of shadow    underemployment or unemployment are disproportionately high relative to U-3. One implication, as President Rosengren mentioned, is that the labor force participation  rate may move sideways as the labor market strengthens over the next few years.  That’s what     Tealbook envisions, and we may, therefore, see U3 declines at a slower pace than recently.   There was some discussion of labor market shortages.  President Fisher, in particular,  noted increased concern in Texas with the shortage of qualified job candidates.  That said,  211 of 302\f",
      "outside of a couple of regions, occupations, and sectors, several of you mentioned that there isn’t     much evidence of general pressure on wages and compensation.  President Lockhart mentioned  that part-time workers appear to be holding wage growth down.  By almost all metrics, the  overall movements we have seen in compensation still show little evidence of acceleration,     which is consistent with substantial remaining slack.  President Evans mentioned that his    business contacts at this point show no concern with wage or broader cost pressures.     Moreover, the ability of firms to replace workers with labor-saving technology—and    they’re willing to do so if they encounter wage pressures, a phenomenon President Fisher    described in his remarks—could be a further factor holding wage growth down.  In fact, I   personally wonder if such technological possibilities may be contributing to the tendency we’ve   seen for quite a number of years now for real wage growth to lag productivity growth.  One of  my own concerns—and this is something that Governor Tarullo mentioned—is that if wage   growth doesn’t turn up, we may not see rapid enough income gains to support the consumer    spending forecast in Tealbook.  If the markup and the share of labor income in GDP do not       stabilize, and if the marginal propensity to consume out of labor income exceeds that from   capital income, we could easily see growth remaining stuck near 2 percent rather than gradually    strengthening as in the Tealbook forecast.  On the issue of sustainability of continued labor market gains, many of you—and I think  I would include in this list Presidents Mester, Williams, George, Plosser, Dudley, Fisher, Bullard,  and Evans and Governor Tarullo—perhaps I’ve missed some—expressed an  expectation that the economy will continue to grow rapidly enough to sustain labor market gains.    The decline in GDP in the first quarter was surprisingly large, but many of you cited a wide     range of evidence suggesting that we are in the midst of a significant rebound.  Many of you, like   212 of 302\f",
      "President George, noted a list of good reasons for aggregate demand to grow at a moderate pace in the remainder of the year.  These include diminishing fiscal drag and accommodative    monetary policy, rising household net worth, and generally improved balance sheets, with continued solid gains in employment.   President Lockhart and others noted signs that the credit conditions are easing.  In  addition, Presidents Lockhart and Evans and Governor Tarullo cited some evidence from surveys  and your business contacts suggesting that investment spending should strengthen.  A number of   you described your impressions of business sentiment, with President Evans, I believe,  describing it as good, not great, which is consistent with my own impression from recent  meetings with business leaders.  I apologize— Presidents Fisher, Plosser, Lacker, Lockhart, and Fisher—I said “President Fisher” twice,     \n",

      "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  The   minimalist approach to changing the statement makes eminent sense at a time when we are     providing a gradual, transparent, and predictable path to the taper program.  The weakness in the   real economy in the first half of this year, coupled with our “steady as she goes” taper    communications strategy, successfully avoided significant increases in interest rates or increased    volatility, either of which might have further disrupted the recovery.    Exit strategies can be difficult to maneuver even with a less complicated set of tools.  The     lessons I take from the four predictable taperings to date, based in part on the positive market  response, is that our experience with the gradual and predictable slowing in balance sheet    increases may be instructive when we begin to reduce our balance sheet.  To be explicit, when it  becomes appropriate to reduce the size of our balance sheet, we may choose to do so gradually    and predictably with the actual timing and size of tapered reductions depending on how the   economy evolves.  In terms of the two questions that you posed, I am fine with ending the purchases as you   suggest—$5 billion on a $4 trillion balance sheet is the definition of rounding error.  As a result,    I don’t view it as a policy statement or a policy view.  I think it’s a technical adjustment.  As a     result, I don’t think it belongs in the statement.  I actually think that it should be in response to a   question and more seem like an offhand remark because I think that’s probably what it deserves.      Thank you. \n",

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have just four comments.  I’ll enumerate  them here, and then expand on them.  My first comment is that, in my opinion, the current policy path is not state-contingent enough.  It is too driven by calendar considerations, along with our  median forecast.  I think—echoing a little bit of what Governor Fischer said—the world is more     stochastic than what we have in mind as we sit here today.  I’ll talk about that a little bit.   Second, I think these calendar plans are driven in part by the press conference schedule.    I’m going to suggest that for something like the discussion of operating procedure, perhaps an  off-schedule press conference would be more appropriate.  I’ll talk a little bit about that.   Third, I think we also have this nagging issue of the meaning of the ending of the QE   program, which you just brought up, Chair Yellen.  We’ve got $5 billion on the table in the fall.    I don’t think it will be credible to say that this is a meaningful asset purchase, so I agree with you     on that.  I’ll talk about that for just a minute.     Then I want to get back to this issue of reinvestments.  For my comments on   reinvestments, I’m going to put my dove feathers on, so you all have to get ready for that.  And I’m going to disagree with the characterization of Vice Chairman Dudley.  I think he is too   hawkish on this issue, so I’ll give my case for that.  I think ending reinvestment is actually a buffer step—that’s the way I have always viewed it.  It’s a buffer step between ending QE and    raising the policy rate, and I think it’s going to aid our communication, not harm our  communication, so I’ll talk about that a little bit.  I think taking that buffer step out of the exit    process is going to make for a much rockier ride as we get close to the date of policy liftoff.  Let   me just elaborate on these points a little bit.    First of all, I think current policy is not sufficiently state-contingent.  It’s too driven by  calendar considerations.  Some of you may recall that last year at this time Chairman Bernanke     237 of 302\f",
      "had a press conference.  It was a raucous one.  He said at that press conference that   unemployment would be 7 percent by June 2014, and that QE would be ended.  We are    amazingly far ahead of this schedule on unemployment—we’re at 6.3 percent—and far behind on policy adjustment.  We haven’t brought the QE program to a close as of this point.   With most forecasts predicting rapid growth in the current quarter and through the rest of    the year, we may have to consider altering plans and deviating from our preset pace.  Calendar- based policy has a high risk of getting out of sync with actual economic developments.  Inflation  also, in my view, is poised to head higher.  We saw yesterday that, by far, the largest component   of the staff inflation forecast is a constant, representing longer-term inflation expectations.   I do not think it is reasonable to interpret longer-term inflation expectations as drifting    down at this juncture since, for instance, the SPF expectations of core PCE inflation remain at  2 percent, and other measures are also stable.  Accordingly, I think everyone should add 25 basis  points to the staff forecast for inflation, which then puts inflation at target in the medium term.   That is certainly how I would interpret the forecast, and my own forecasts have inflation at target  or, indeed, exceeding target in the not-too-distant future.   If inflation expectations are declining, then that is a very serious issue, indeed, for the   Committee, and I agree completely with President Kocherlakota on this.  I have advocated this in   the past, that we definitely need to defend our inflation target from below.  But I’m not  convinced that they are drifting down at this point.  I’ll keep an open mind about it, but I’m not   convinced about it.  Also, I do not agree that if longer-term inflation expectations are drifting  down that that’s a problem that can be fixed by cyclical adjustment.    The way I would think about models is that you’ve got those inflation expectations more   or less fixed, and that the economy is going to cycle around those expectations, and it’s going to  238 of 302\f",
      "be very hard to move away from them.  Even if inflation goes above the longer-term  expectations, markets would be interpreting that as a cyclical factor, not as a structural factor.     It’s really very troubling for the Committee if we cannot center inflation expectations on our    goal.  But I—again, my view is that we are centered on our goal, and it would take more   convincing to get me to move off that view in the near term.  Let me turn to the calendar-based plans.  A lot of our plans are based on the calendar and  envision press conferences by Chair Yellen as a primary communication vehicle.  I have     advocated, and continue to advocate, that we design all FOMC meetings to be ex-ante identical    with a press conference attached.  Financial markets, in my view, seek reassurance from the  Chair that they understand the Committee’s thinking on current monetary policy issues.  Our   current system puts a lot of pressure on particular meetings and particular press conferences.  I    think it mixes messages about the current state of monetary policy—which is always a concern—   and current interpretation of what is going on in the economy with other longer-term issues that  we might want to address at that particular juncture.      conference.  You could have a separate press conference that would focus entirely on future    monetary policy implementation issues and focus all the questions on that.  You could talk about  the overnight reverse repo facility until you’re blue in the face without bringing in the current   policy stance of the Committee and the day-to-day monetary policy issues.  I’m just suggesting that as a possibility.  One advantage of that is you could schedule it when it was appropriate,   when the Committee felt like we got to the right juncture, so I just put it on the table as a   possibility. 239 of 302\f",
      "Let me turn to the issue about ending QE.  As other people have remarked, it is a small     issue, but it does affect the expected timeline of policy rate liftoff.  I appreciate Chair Yellen       bringing this up.  I think buying $5 billion in assets is just not credible.  It will be viewed by        with Chair Yellen that the last step should probably be just go down to zero, and I would not put   this in the policy statement.  I agree that this is something that could be dealt with, as President     Rosengren suggested, as sort of an offhand comment and go from there.  Now, however, I do think that this reinvestment issue is a serious one for our exit     strategy, so, again, I’m going to put my dove feathers on here and fly around the room a little bit.    Ending reinvestment, in my view, is a buffer step between ending QE and raising the policy rate.  One of the things we have been concerned about is, as we get to the end of the QE program, all   of the talk is going to be about, well, are they going to raise rates at the next meeting, and so on.   By having this buffer step, it’s an intermediate decision that the Committee could make during  this period between ending QE and raising the policy rate.  It would be clear that the Committee     is going to have to make that decision, and would suggest that the Committee has enough  confidence in the economy at that juncture to go ahead with that decision before actually getting    to the rate increase.   It should not have a large effect on the economy, certainly not a large macroeconomic  effect according to the models that we have.  Even if you think it might have a large     macroeconomic effect, you could certainly manage it in an effective way, as was discussed  yesterday—that is, we could stipulate that the size of the balance sheet would fall along a smooth   path, or, if you wanted to do the reinvestment maybe into shorter-term Treasury securities, you  could do some of that.  I think there are various ways to manage it.  It doesn’t have to just be an   240 of 302\f",
      "abrupt decision to end reinvestment.  I suggest we keep the step of ending reinvestment as a   useful tool during the interim period between ending QE and raising the policy rate.   My views are different from Vice Chairman Dudley’s.  He gave four reasons to move  ending reinvestments back in the timeline.  My interpretations are different.  First, he argued     ending reinvestments would signal the beginning of tightening.  Well, yes, but only in the sense  that it would signal that the Committee was confident enough to move a step closer to raising the     policy rate.  In my view, that’s a useful thing to be able to do, because there’s going to be a lot of    pressure on the Committee about when are we going to raise the policy rate once the QE   program ends.  Taking the end of reinvestment off the table would mean that the immediate,  concrete next step for the Committee would be to raise the policy rate.  Indeed, Vice Chairman   Dudley suggested that part of the idea is to get off the zero bound sooner rather than later, which  I’m not so sure is my sentiment, or maybe the sentiment of the Committee.  We want to get off  the zero lower bound at exactly the right time, ideally.    Vice Chairman Dudley also cited communications challenges, but my argument is that  the end of reinvestment is a helpful and useful buffer step that the Committee can use to signal  that the Committee has enough confidence to raise the policy rate in the meetings following the   date of ending reinvestment.  Finally, Vice Chairman Dudley made a risk-management argument, but my view would  be that we can change balance sheet policy as necessary in response to macroeconomic events.     We have done that in recent years, including our open-ended QE program.  On this dimension, I   agree with President Kocherlakota.  If we get into trouble on the downside, if the economy looks  to be worse, or the inflation outlook looks to be worse than we expected, then I would think we   would have to go back and use our balance sheet tool as we have in recent years.  But it’s not     241 of 302\f",
      "looking like that’s the way the economy is going, at least sitting here today.  The bottom line on  this issue:  I think it would make our job harder, and possibly much harder, if we move the    ending reinvestment decision to after the policy rate decision.   For today, Madam Chair, I can support alternative B, but I think some of the issues I     mentioned here do need attention in the coming meetings.  I do not think we should add the  sentence suggested by President Kocherlakota at this time.  My own forecast has inflation   moving higher faster and actually above target.  Just as a last comment, I am not one that views the inflation target as some kind of     ceiling.  I do think you should hit it on average over a period of time, and maybe this is    something that the Committee should have a broader discussion about.  If you hit your inflation target on average over a period of time, you are going to be much closer to price-level targeting.    It isn’t exactly price-level targeting, but it’s much closer to price-level targeting.  That’s optimal   policy in the kinds of sticky price models that are informing a lot of the judgments around this  Committee.  I’m one that thinks, as long as we can hit it on average, that’s fine.  Let me just end   with that comment.  Thank you, Madam Chair.   \n",

      "MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B today.  The FOMC  has signaled that it would take a significant change to the outlook before it would deviate from   the path of reducing asset purchases by $10 billion per meeting.  While there are risks and      uncertainty, economic developments suggest our forecast remains largely intact.  Growth is    expected to rise over the forecast horizon with employment increasing and inflation moving gradually back to our goal.  Thus, I believe we should continue on the policy path the Committee   has laid out and reduce monthly purchases by another $10 billion.    Regarding the ambiguity about whether our purchases will end in October or December if  we keep on our tapering path, I agree with the Chair that this is really immaterial from an    economic point of view.  Hence, I have no strong preferences for October or December.  Rather    than clarify the ambiguity in the statement, which would elevate its importance, I support the  Chair’s proposal to do this in the press conference, and I guess I would say if you’re confident  you’re going to get the question, fine.  If you think there’s some possibility the question won’t    come up, then I would just suggest doing it in your prepared remarks to clarify the ambiguity and   get the issue off the table.  Turning to language, I have no problem with the statement as written in alternative B.    My preference is to make minimal changes today, but with the end of purchases looming and  with rate increases anticipated sometime next year, provided the economy evolves as anticipated,   I believe it will very soon be time to change the guidance indicating that liftoff will be a    considerable time after the asset purchases end.  My preference would be to replace this language   with state-contingent language, although, given the history of the language, I understand this to  be an aspirational goal.  247 of 302\f",
      "To the extent our policy is forward looking and liftoff is tied to the outlook, perhaps  examining the SEP—although I realize that may be a dirty word—either the data that we just   collected or a follow-up to it, may give us more understanding of the conditions that Committee    participants see at the time of liftoff.  In any case, it would seem prudent to come up with  language alternatives for consideration sooner rather than later.  Thank you, Madam Chair.    \n",

      "MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written, and I’m  very comfortable with your approach on October, of saying that we will cut $15 billion in    In a sense, the normalization process effectively began one year ago at this meeting when   the Committee first officially socialized with the public the idea that quantitative easing might    not go on forever, resulting in the well-known taper tantrum.  This is the first normalization cycle  in 10 years, I think, and if I counted correctly, it’s the eighth one of my adult life, but it’s the first   one I will have experienced inside these walls.  I’ve been thinking about ways to learn more  about the process and different ways to think about it.  For me, the starting point is the Tealbook  baseline, which represents for me an acceptable modal outlook and a policy framework that   brings the economy to full employment and our inflation objective in a reasonable period of    time; in the case of inflation, not as fast as desired.    Beyond that, it also seems to me useful to learn from the taper, as President Rosengren  suggested and others, too, I think, and also to understand how past Committees have approached the problem and think further, in addition, about the risks to the forecast and the loss function     you might apply to those risks if realized.  As a result of all that, working with the Board staff,    I’ve started to look at earlier tightening cycles to see what light they might shed, and market   participants and commentators are out there doing exactly the same thing.  For example, I met   with Board staff and also with a hedge fund a couple of weeks ago that had looked at the  previous seven policy normalization cycles and found a clear pattern under which the increase in  long-term rates in a tightening cycle has increasingly taken place before the FOMC’s first actual    rate hike, which I think sheds some light and helps make some sense on last summer’s taper  tantrum.  It also makes the long-end rally of the first half of this year look even more oddly  251 of 302\f",
      "timed, and maybe I’ll take this opportunity to comment on President Lacker’s comment.  I fully agree that it would be healthy to see a return to higher levels of volatility and higher rates, too,    for that matter.  Some of you may also have seen the Goldman piece of last week, which looked at the    prior three tightening cycles that began in 1994, 1999, and 2004, and I went through those cycles    with the help of Board staff with this piece in mind.  In both 1994 and 2004, the Committee’s   first rate increase happened at a time when headline unemployment was about ½ percentage point above the staff’s contemporaneous estimate of the natural rate.  In today’s forecast, that fits    pretty well.  That would suggest liftoff around the time of this meeting next year, which is in line  with the baseline forecast of Q2.  I know this analysis is based on two data points.   Interestingly to me, in 1999, the Committee didn’t tighten until unemployment was  nearly a full percentage point below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  The special     circumstances then, as we all know, I suspect, were persistent low inflation of below 1½ percent   for both core and headline PCE associated with the well-known IT-driven productivity gains.   And there are obvious special circumstances here today:  Inflation is unusually low and it’s     further below target than in any of these prior tightening cycles and expected to remain so; and      there’s also the general specialness of this era in which a damaged economy is slowly repairing  itself.  But these are already baked into our forecast, and our policy rate path is now in line with the optimal control simulations and more accommodative than all of the simple policy rules in    Tealbook B, except nominal income targeting.  There’s no obvious message in this for me about     liftoff.  Others may see that differently.  The bigger question is probably the risks to the modal forecast and the weights one puts   on those risks.  I do see a risk of a lower inflation path, as I mentioned earlier.  I also see a risk to    252 of 302\f",

      "MR. ENGLISH.  I think the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate reflects a number of factors, but one is the balance sheet cost to the borrowing banks, of having a larger balance sheet.  One is imperfect competition in that market, and understanding how that would play out if there were, say, a gap of 50 basis points between the IOER rate and overnight RRP rate, instead of 25 basis points, is just very difficult to know. We don’t, I think, have enough understanding of exactly who the marginal player is and what the pressures are on the marginal player that are determining that spread to know how that would work.  It is possible that if you raised the IOER rate, the way the markets would play out is you’d end up with roughly the same spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate, other short-term market rates.  Rates would just kind of move up together, and that would work out okay.  But we are not confident of that and the evidence that we have seen from the overnight RRP exercises is that it does help to provide a firmer floor under money market rates.  I think it would provide greater confidence when it comes time to liftoff.  You’d get the effects on market rates that you desire. \n",

The second question I had was we talked a lot about monetary control, and I know that is very important obviously, and it is obviously important because we are going to talk about a federal funds target range, and there is an expectation that we are going to hit that.  Simon and, I think, Vice Chairman Dudley at various points have talked about how there could be a disconnect between the funds rate and other money market rates.  Are we contemplating any communications about the transmission mechanism for monetary policy? That strikes me as a very important additional line of communication.  It could be the case that at some point the funds rate is going to be soft relative to our target.  These are things that historically we’ve experienced at various times, and you can imagine some collection of financial market indicators, money market rates of some sort, auto loans, the things that matter for transmission, and if we could point to them moving up in our announcements, that would mitigate the embarrassment if there’s some period of softness.

As to your second question, the index does, in fact, include other measures of wages, measures of hiring, layoffs, people working part time for economic reasons, and things like that.  So it is trying to capture a broader set of indicators of labor market slack than the unemployment rate alone.  Some of those other indicators are what is driving that prediction for the unemployment rate in the right-hand side of that box.  It would show less decline than the actual unemployment rate over the past year. The LMCI is really meant to measure the change in the unemployment rate over time or the change of labor market conditions over time.  It hasn’t proven to be a very good measure of the level of labor market slack.  It’s difficult to interpret in that context.  So what we’ve emphasized here is the change.  And the change in labor market conditions according to this index hasn’t been as strong as the decline in the unemployment rate. \n",

      "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As usual, I found the financial stability report to be very useful.  I’d like to especially thank the staff for the incorporation of financial-stability risks into the analysis of macroeconomic risks, and here I’m thinking of the discussions of low equity volatility, on page 46 of Tealbook, Book A; credit market turbulence, on page 58 of Tealbook, Book A; and the China crisis memo. I really like the dashboard in the QS report.  This was on page 2.  I think it could be enhanced even further by reducing the number of words in it and just having colors—simplifying it further for policymakers.  You know, it could be highlighted even more.  I don’t think it was brought forward in the presentation today, and I think it’s a great way to frame the assessment of financial-stability risks. Madam Chair, I have three comments about three financial-stability issues.  The first is about bank legal risk.  The second is about a way to incorporate more information into the financial-stability briefing.  And the third is about the overnight reverse repo facility.  The last two are very brief. In terms of legal risk, the QS report noted the potential for legal risk, which is exemplified by recent misconduct findings against very large banks, to shock the financial system.  This legal risk kind of shock could raise concerns about counterparty risk, which in turn could lead to liquidity shortages.  I think we’ve made good steps to bolster the financial system against these kinds of episodes, but such liquidity threats have to be seen as remaining very serious in the context of resolution regimes that still are in need of substantial enhancements. Now, I think this legal risk is a nice example of how possible financial instability need not imply that we should keep monetary policy less accommodative than otherwise.  After all, there is no sense in which you can reduce legal risk by raising interest rates or reducing the size 144 of 306\f",
      "of our balance sheet.  In fact, the presence of this risk could actually be seen as arguing for more accommodation, not less.  Here’s what I mean by that.  A negative systemic shock caused by the realization of legal risk that occurs after liftoff could lead us back to the zero lower bound, and at that point, definitionally, we would be unable to provide as much stimulus as we would like in order to offset the shock. How should monetary policy respond to the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in the future?  Well, the basic conclusion of the macro literature is that risk of insufficient stimulus in the future implies that it’s optimal to preemptively provide additional current stimulus.  So potential instability due to legal risk is actually a reason to keep interest rates lower than otherwise, not a reason to keep monetary policy tighter than otherwise. In terms of additional information, again, here I’m going to be brief.  The QS financial stability report is based only on public information.  I think the stability analysis coming to the FOMC could benefit from more direct incorporation of assessments based on supervisory evaluations.  Now, these assessments are based on information that’s private to the Fed, and I’m sure that the public pretty much expects the FOMC to be able to use this private information to inform our assessments of financial-stability risks. To be clear, if we so desired, this analysis based on supervisory information could be entirely separate from the current QS analysis, and it could, if so desired, remain at the aggregate level to avoid discussions of specific firms.  I think it could be very helpful to have this kind of information brought in at an aggregate level.  There’s no reason necessarily to be discussing specific firms.  So that’s the additional information piece. In terms of the overnight reverse repo facility, what I took away from the thrust of the dialogue we heard earlier today is that the overnight facility will end up being used during the 145 of 306\f",
      "course of liftoff.  At the same time, I think both the staff and participants have pointed to potential financial-stability risks associated with the usage of that facility.  It would be useful, I think, to begin the process of incorporating those kinds of risks into the financial stability report that the Committee receives.  Thank you, Madam Chair. \n",

      "MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As President Plosser just mentioned and as others have remarked, the extent of the first-quarter contraction in real GDP is deeply puzzling in light of the wide array of data that point to solid gains in economic activity.  So my staff actually went to see how big this disconnect was between the GDP number—the decline of nearly 3 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter—and what we saw in the other data.  For this purpose they used a statistical FAVAR model that takes 121 individual economic indicators and looks for the common trend in those.  And this FAVAR model that doesn’t use GDP would have predicted real GDP growth of 2¾ percent in the first quarter—almost exactly what was reported, except for the sign.  [Laughter] So it is a striking statistical way to see that what we are saying, and what I think the Board staff said in the Tealbook, is really supported by the data.  Pretty much everything that we threw in the hopper was telling us that we were continuing with moderate growth.  Now, I wouldn’t declare the entire shortfall in first-quarter growth to be a measurement error, but I do agree with the Tealbook and many others that it does appear that the first-quarter GDP number is an anomaly.  We shouldn’t take much signal from it in terms of the underlying pace of expansion.  And overall, the broad set of incoming data is consistent with moderate growth for the rest of the year, as well as gradual progress toward our inflation goal.  My forecast for the next few years is very similar to the Tealbook’s.  The only difference, which has been there for some time, is that I expect inflation to come back toward our 2 percent goal slightly faster than the Tealbook does. One area that continues to surprise on the upside is the labor market.  Again, I think we have seen a wide range of indicators in the labor market showing improvement as good as or better than we were expecting.  Notably, payroll and household employment have been showing 163 of 306\f",
      "solid gains.  Many of us have already referred to this good news concerning the labor market, but the one striking exception is the tepid pace of compensation growth, which, despite the improvement in the labor market, continues to run around 2 percent or so.  And this is obviously an important issue, because we look at wage growth both as a sign of the state of the labor of its effects on inflationary pressures, in terms of our inflation mandate. A couple of meetings ago I talked about some of the research at the San Francisco Fed about the effects of downward nominal wage rigidities that may be influencing the pattern of compensation growth and holding it back over the past couple of years.  But still, there is a deeper puzzle about what has been happening with wages for several years, and I am going to focus the rest of my comments on some of the longer-term structural changes in the labor growth and also inflationary pressures.  It’s good to remember that in many economic models, including FRB/US and most DSGE models, labor share is a key driver of marginal cost and inflationary pressures. Over the past few years, labor share in the nonfarm business sector has averaged about 57 percent, which is well below its long-run historical average of around 62 percent.  If you take it at face value, which most models would do, this metric—this very low labor share—would suggest very low cost pressures for inflation.  It suggests also that wage growth should be quite strong in the period ahead.  However, my message is one of caution against relying on where the labor share is relative to some historical measure of its normal value in gauging either labor 164 of 306\f",
      "One of the things that many of us were taught is that the labor share in the United States is relatively constant.  And that was true for several decades.  But in fact, when you do a deeper dive, looking underneath the fact that labor share is relatively constant for the first four decades after World War II, there were actually a lot of things happening.  In certain sectors it was going up, and in others it was going down.  So in a way it was pure coincidence that it happened to seem so flat.  Actually, since the late 1980s, we have seen a substantial downward trend in labor share.  And the fact that it has been going on for so long—it’s not related to the current recession or recovery—suggests that there really are structural, rather than cyclical, factors driving this, or at least most of this. There is quite a bit of literature on this now, talking about what could be causing labor share to decline.  Maybe it’s information technology capital replacing routine labor, the effects of globalization, or the reduced bargaining power of workers.  Due to the timing of the decline, one of the prime suspects has been the increasing rate at which IT capital is replacing labor.  If robots replace workers on the auto assembly line, a greater share of the price of a car may go to capital rather than labor.  Another explanation involves globalization:  If the labor-intensive jobs, such as those at call centers, are offshored, the income share of the U.S. economy going to domestic workers is reduced. Of course, these explanations for a lower labor share are likely complementary and reinforcing, and I am not going to take a stand on the question, is it IT, is it labor bargaining power, or is it globalization.  But the key theme that comes out of this literature is that these are long-running structural changes in our labor market.  So in our own thinking about where the economy is going, we shouldn’t be expecting labor share to go back to some normal historical level.  In fact, looking forward, it is really hard to know which way labor share should go.  165 of 306\f",
      "Should it stay at its very low level of around 57 percent?  Should it rise somewhat as the economy improves?  Or maybe this downward trend will actually continue into the future. So I view labor share, which used to be viewed as one of these cosmological constants—these great stylized facts of macroeconomics, like potential output growth, like the natural rate of interest, and a lot of things that we took for granted were constant, probably never really were, and clearly aren’t today.  And so in thinking about the implications of that, I think what it means is that we shouldn’t be expecting labor share to be moving back.  We should be more realistic about our ability to measure the equilibrium value of wages, or real wages, relative to productivity. Looking forward, if we thought the labor share would return to its earlier postwar benchmark, we would be expecting strong compensation growth relative to productivity growth.  But my reading of this literature is that a large part of this decline is really driven by structural factors, and a full recovery in the labor market may have real wages growing at no more than the pace of potential productivity growth, and perhaps actually below that, because if you have a productivity growth. So I think it’s one of the factors that can help us understand why wage growth hasn’t been as strong as we might have thought.  I still think there is a significant cyclical aspect of this.  I’m not downplaying that.  But we have been going through all of the factors that might explain why wage growth has been well below what we thought.  And I think we just have to keep this in mind when we think about what the new normal for the economy is.  Pretty much every variable seems to have a new normal, and we need to adjust this in our models and our thinking.  Thank you. 166 of 306\n",

It’s the red-tabbed section in the beginning of the book that is condensed. When I went to Chairman Bernanke a year ago and requested permission to try a short-form DEDO, I made several pledges to him.  First, I pledged that we would do it on an experimental basis, and, if it was judged a failure, we’d go back to the long form every time.  Second, I pledged that we would invest the same amount of analytical effort every time regardless of whether the exposition was condensed or full length.  And, third, I pledged that, if circumstances warranted and something came up that seemed to call for a full reset in long-form, and perhaps more confusing, format, we’d stand prepared to do that.  We couldn’t do that overnight, but we could do it on pretty short notice. That was the premise under which this was taken.  We find it, frankly, more conducive to investing in some of the special analytical material that I tried to highlight in some of my comments yesterday.  And I have wondered, indeed, whether it didn’t present the material in a manner that was easier for you to digest as well and therefore might be a value-improving proposition. \n",

Then what would the optimal policy rate path look like?  That would be helpful.  Or, if you think medium- or longer-term inflation expectations have drifted up, then what would the optimal policy rate path look like here?  That would be a variant on what Vice Chairman Dudley said regarding changing assumptions—but I think of changing assumptions in a somewhat different way than what he was describing and exploring. you. Also, I have to say, to come into a policy meeting and present this kind of stuff right before we’re looking at the alternatives—I think it would be more helpful to do something that would say, “If you choose alternative C, here’s what you’ll get.  If you choose alternative A, here’s what you’ll get.

      "MR. FISHER.  First, I want to thank you for the humility with which you’ve presented it and for the heat with which you’ve just expressed the contrast between the two.  I do want to go back to the interchange I had with Mr. Wascher yesterday.  We went back and did a little research.  This is just to take a snippet of what Vice Chairman Dudley started out with.  I was born in 1949.  It so happens that the CBO’s statistics on the natural rate go back to 1949—just so we are on the same factual basis.  And, very importantly, as the only former market operator in this room, I note that these are the kinds of things you look at for context—the natural rate has never been below 5 percent.  This is with all of the benefit of hindsight that we have from the CBO, going back to 1949.  It did bump along at that level in the first decade of this century.  Its high, of course—in 1978, when things were pretty awful, it was 6.27 percent.  It was 5¼ percent or greater in the 1950s and 1960s.  In fact, it was 5.86 percent in 1969. Now, the Tealbook baseline calls for an unemployment rate falling to 4½ percent.  It’s a reasonable hypothesis, and we can also talk about the confidence bands and so on.  But, as a affect my expectations or raise the question “Are they going too far?”  And that might be reflected in the financial instruments that we look at, which, we admit, are imperfect in terms of understanding inflationary expectations.   You pointed to the survey data.  That’s one thing.  I noticed yesterday that Esther pointed to the short-term numbers.  But, again, the way market operators think—and this is the beginning, I think, of Bill’s statement, even though that’s not where he came out—it looks a little out of context.  That’s my point.  I don’t know the degree to which we can test this, but this has been my concern:  If we push too far beyond the norm—with a history in which we’ve never been, in at least my lifetime of 65 years, below 5 percent—then that may begin to affect the 225 of 306\f",
      "market expectation or it may raise some eyebrows.  That’s all I’m saying, and that’s why I’ve raised it two meetings in a row.  I wish there was a way to test that.  I don’t know if we can.  But I’m not comfortable—again, it was a humble statement, but whether we say “idiopathic” or “idiosyncratic,” we’re just saying we don’t know.  It’s an important variable, but we can’t really figure out why.  Is that correct? climate.  It is a fact. \n",

      "MR. EVANS.  At any rate, the discussion on the inflation forecast is an important one and interesting.  I would remind everybody that the Board’s staff circulated a memo several meetings ago in which they went into some depth as to how the inflation forecasting relationship behaved.  That memo is at the heart of the discomfort here because it’s more natural in a theoretical sense and all of our intuition to have short-term inflation expectations in there, at least over the medium term.  But, in fact, it’s hard to fit that.  It just doesn’t work so well.  So the Board staff has quite reasonably adopted the specification in which it’s long-term inflation expectations, and those are anchored.  It’s hard to move those.  And all of our intuition is that, well, the short term might be moving around.  So it may be that a little more discussion of that at the relevant time would be good for this. On uncertainty, we’ve raised uncertainty many times.  I believe, David, that every time you made a probabilistic statement, I agreed with the way that you characterized that.  But I want to be very careful.  In response to the chart that was displayed yesterday, “Forecast Summary,” with inflation in the big error bands, one attitude is to say uncertainty is big and throw up your hands.  But, in fact, you can make more-disciplined probabilistic statements.  According to this, unless I’m reading it wrong, it is still the case that the probability that inflation will come in below 2 percent is higher than the probability that it will be above 2 percent.  So there is discipline that needs to be imposed on our probabilistic statements in that regard. \n",

The incoming data since our last meeting have been favorable, and they indicate that a solid rebound from the first-quarter drop in GDP is well under way.  The improvement in labor market conditions has been especially encouraging, and inflation does appear to be heading back toward our longer-term target.  I think alternative B, the first paragraph, acknowledges these improvements appropriately, and the changes in the second paragraph also nod to the fact that inflation and labor market conditions are moving toward our goals. It will be some time, however, before excess labor market slack is sufficiently reduced and underlying inflation has picked up enough to warrant an outright tightening of policy.  These circumstances call for maintaining the current course of monetary policy, including the further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and maintaining the forward guidance that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate at this time.

      "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I would be opposed to removing the word “significant” in paragraph 1.  I think, especially since that word appeared in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, it’s appropriate to leave it in at this time. I do agree with some of the comments from participants around the table that we will need to revisit the words “considerable time” in the very near term and try to provide more clarity about what exactly we mean by that.  I would hope we do that in terms of economic conditions and not so much in terms of dates, but I think that, very soon, in the September–tough questions about that. For a long period of time, this Committee has been struggling with the employment mandate and focused on the employment mandate as really the main challenge facing us.  I’m increasingly thinking that the big challenge for us is really on price stability, and the perhaps overly extended dialogue that we had leading into this round highlights some of those challenges.  Staff estimates right now are that inflation expectations are 1¾ percent.  I think that, if you carefully read the memo that we received in June, this estimate is unduly generous to this Committee.  If you actually read the numbers behind the assessment, you could have gone with a lower number, as Mr. Wilcox mentioned earlier, in fact. We heard lots of passion yesterday about the loss of credibility associated with missing the federal funds rate target range by 10 basis points for one day.  We need to bring that same level of passion, or even more, to the prospect of missing our inflation target by 25 basis points or more over an extended period.  When we have a flat Phillips curve, that miss of 25 basis points represents lots of resource loss and lots of underutilization.  And I’m concerned that 246 of 306\f",
      "FOMC participants seem comfortable with long-run misses of inflation.  Maybe I’m misreading the conversation—I apologize if I am.  But I am concerned that I’m hearing a degree of sanguineness about having inflation underrun our target for a very long period of time. President Evans asked me if I had some good points to make, and I said I didn’t, but I do have a lot of points.  [Laughter]  President Plosser, I think, raised a good point about how our behavior is likely to deviate from rules as we move forward.  One reason for that lies in the behavior of inflation.  Inflation has been so low for so long relative to target that we’re starting to see these estimates of what inflation expectations are drift downward.  That really forces us to be more accommodative than we’d otherwise be, given the current metrics. As we contemplate how to interpret those words “considerable time,” my own thinking about how we should be formulating the conditions governing liftoff is really in terms of the inflation mandate and the price stability mandate.  It’s very hard to justify liftoff taking place when the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation is below 2 percent.  In my mind, there’s no reason for us to be lowering rates simply because unemployment has gotten too low.  That’s built into Tealbook objectives—that there’s a loss associated with unemployment being too low.  I don’t read our statutory mandate as saying that you should not have unemployment be too low.  I don’t read our communications from our long-run goals statement as saying, “We don’t want unemployment to be too low.”  So I would not be supportive of raising rates simply because unemployment has fallen too low. The other piece that’s built into Tealbook objectives is a desire to keep interest rates smooth.  In fact, as the Tealbook, Book B, notes, a lot of weight is put on that.  I don’t see that in our statutory mandates.  I don’t see it in our long-run goals or communications.  For those reasons, I don’t put weight on that in my objective. 247 of 306\f",
      "Accordingly, I would see no reason for us to be raising rates as long as the inflation outlook remained below 2 percent.  I say “no reason.”  There is one reason—potential financial instability concerns, which I’ve talked about in the past.  But I agree with Governor Fischer here.  As long as housing is not being affected by this, it’s really hard for me to see how this is going to get into the broader economy.  That’s where you’re going to see it—in housing.  Until we see it there—and we’re a long way from that, unfortunately—I don’t think that’s going to be a risk. When I think about how to reframe “considerable time,” it would be to frame it in terms of the necessary condition for liftoff being a one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation of 2 percent.

      "CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Well, thanks to everybody.  The comments on policy have been very thoughtful, and I think we’re actually in considerable agreement about where we’re heading.  I believe everybody recognizes that we’re on a path here where, if the data continue to come in strong and to create a series of positive surprises, we’re likely going to be moving up sooner than we previously anticipated, and that we will have to signal our intention to do that in a series of steps.  I am more than prepared to go in that direction if the data continue as they have been.  So, to my mind, the questions with respect to language concern the sequence of steps that so many of you have talked about and what’s the right move for today. It’s always hard to know what the market reaction is going to be to language.  I think, as many of you have indicated, the change in the characterization of the inflation outlook is going to be noted quite carefully and taken as a signal of a somewhat “hawkier” stance.  I don’t know what markets will think of the word “significant,” but my own interpretation was that it was exactly in line with what the Vice Chairman indicated—that it means “appreciable” or “meaningful,” and that the overall thrust of that paragraph is, we’re no longer saying the unemployment rate is elevated.  We’re saying that not only has the unemployment rate declined, but we think labor market indicators quite generally show that there’s also been improvement in the labor market, and we’ve moved away from “elevated.”  But I do think it’s accurate to say that the degree of underutilization is significant. Obviously, I’ve heard many of you who would be inclined to change the word “significant.”  Also, I’ve heard a considerable number of you who think that it’s the right word for today.  My preference would be to stick with “significant,” and I suppose this point that this is exactly the language that, just over a week ago, I uttered in testimony and was in our Monetary 260 of 306\f",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the testing program.  I think what the staff proposes, of doing it in two stages, makes sense.  Governor Tarullo and Governor Powell circulated a memo that maybe suggested that you could do it in one stage, but I think that two stages is actually a little bit better because you don’t overwhelm participants with a whole bunch of potential changes all at once.  It is easier to discern what each change does in terms of the testing process.  I also think that if you have the testing in phases, you get the advantage of the first phase informing what you want to test in the second phase, which you don’t think it’s really consequential if you do it in one big test or you do it in two tests.  But I would say I prefer the staff’s approach of doing it in two phases. There was one item, though, in the Tarullo–Powell memo that I don’t agree with, which was the idea of not ruling out moving the program up or down in size from the $300 billion symmetrically around $300 billion is you really don’t know whether the amount of headroom—in other words, the difference between the bids and the cap—actually matters in terms of how people bid.  You don’t know whether the amount of headroom that they perceive is going to affect the size of the bids, or whether the floor is more solid with more headroom or less headroom.  I think that, by moving the size of a facility up and down, you are going to actually affect the amount of headroom up and down, and you are going to see whether headroom actually affects the behavior of people who are bidding in the auctions. I also think that moving the size of the facility up or down has some benefit of underscoring that, while size is important to us, we want the facility to be as small as possible, subject to monetary policy control, but size is not the primary objective.  The primary objective   21 of 232\f",
      "is monetary policy control.  If you think monetary control is the most important issue, then I think you don’t want people to be overinvested in $300 billion.  If people really thought that $300 billion was it, and that was what we were going to do no matter what, the program might not work very well.  It would also contaminate the findings of the test.  Let’s imagine that, in fact, we were willing to vary the size ultimately, if it turned out we didn’t have sufficient monetary control, but the market thought that the size was fixed at $300 billion.  Then the test would actually be contaminated by a false set of expectations. I would much prefer when we move to that second stage at the end of October that we vary the size of the program up or down around $300 billion symmetrically, because I think we will get some information from that, and I think we will also make it clear to people that monetary policy control is really our first objective and the size is slightly less important than that.  I don’t think they are going to raise their expectations of size necessarily because we are varying the size, but I just think it means that size is not immutable as we take this program forward. \n",

      "MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  First of all, I would like to echo Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments about the process and listening to everybody.  I think you were very positive in expressing in a memo some of the concerns that I had and listened to the response, and I appreciate that very much.  I also appreciate the fact that it led to some changes that were adopted in the statement. However, I would just like to say, for the record, that I remain uncomfortable with the subbullet that refers to sales of agency and mortgage-backed securities and linking those to reducing residual holdings.  The second main bullet makes clear our intention to reduce the balance sheet primarily through ending repurchases.  I just don’t believe we need to communicate additional reticence over the outright sale of agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process.  While no outright sales may be feasible, given the significant uncertainty surrounding normalization—uncertainty, by the way, that was made abundantly clear in the background memos we received from the staff—it seems to me imprudent and unnecessary to signal such decisions at this point.  It may transpire that adequate control of the funds rate may require us to shrink the balance sheet faster than we now anticipate.  If that were to happen, I would want all potential tools available to proceed under those circumstances.  Further, I remain uncomfortable, as President Lacker so eloquently put it, with the credit allocation policy that this bullet signals. These broad concerns about the balance sheet also lead me to prefer ending reinvestment earlier.  President Lacker just made a very good point, indicating that there are a number of changes we have made from the 2011 principles, and we have done so without much, if any, thorough explanation to the public about why they are being changed.  This suggests we should be reluctant, I think, to insert such tactical considerations in our statement.   42 of 232\f",

      "MR. WILCOX.4  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Before I knew how the timing of the meeting would work out, I composed a little opening bon mot that refers to Rip Van Winkle.  Now, given that you all have a heavy lunch in your stomach, I’m a little loath to proceed with that.  But, being a man of risk-taking, I’m going to do so despite the fact that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.   If you had taken a leaf out of Rip Van Winkle’s playbook and gone to sleep after the June meeting, only to wake up with last week’s edition of the Tealbook splayed across your chest, there probably would have been two main consequences:  First, you’d be feeling much better rested than you are right now and perhaps more favorably inclined to see the virtues of meeting only four times per year rather than eight.  [Laughter]  Second, you probably would not be very surprised by what you found in the September Tealbook.  Relative to June—the last time you submitted SEP numbers—our outlook for inflation is essentially unrevised.  Our assessment of the medium-term outlook for real GDP growth and the labor market is more guarded than in June, but only modestly so.  And, correspondingly, because these differences in the forecasts of your goal variables are small, the path of the funds rate—taken straight from an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule starting in the second quarter of 2015—is close to the one that we posited in June. The changes since the July Tealbook in our forecast for aggregate demand and the labor market have been more substantial, however, and I will take just a moment to try to illuminate why that’s so. In the near term, we downgraded our assessment in light of the July and August employment reports—the first of which was only a little softer than we had expected, but the second more decidedly disappointing, especially with respect to employment growth.  Consumer spending also appears to be on a somewhat weaker trajectory in the second half of the year than we had anticipated in July, even after taking into account the recent strength in auto sales and the information on retail sales and services spending that we received after the September projection was closed. Turning to the particulars and beginning with the first panel of your “Forecast Summary” exhibit, if you have a pair of magnifier glasses like the ones my dentist wears, you might be able to see that the plunge in GDP growth in the first quarter is now estimated to have been a little less steep, and the rebound in the second quarter a bit more robust, than we estimated in the July Tealbook.  Nonetheless, real GDP growth over the first half of the year still looks puzzlingly weak relative to other indicators, most notably the labor market data and industrial production.  As you know, we’ve treated most of this divergence as statistical noise and have continued the practice—which we started in the July round—of adjusting our estimate of potential output so as to keep our assessment of recent product market slack roughly in line with what we think the labor market is telling us about resource utilization.                                                  4 The materials used by Mr. Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).   47 of 232\f",
      "Despite the somewhat less anemic profile of GDP growth over the first half of the year, we’ve nonetheless revised our projection for the second half down by a little.  The main contributor to the downward revision in the second half was the weaker-than-expected July report on consumer spending and our reaction to it.  In light of a string of negative residuals in household spending relative to our models, we extrapolated forward some of the disappointment from the July PCE report.  A secondary contributor to the downward revision in GDP growth over the second half was the dynamics of inventory investment.  Stronger-than-expected inventory investment accounted for a sizable portion of the upward revision to first-half GDP growth.  And we unwound some of this surprise in the second half on the grounds that businesses will probably not opt for permanently higher inventory-to-sales ratios.  In other words, while the overall growth figure for the first half was revised up significantly, an important source of that upward revision occurred in a category that doesn’t normally imply additional momentum for future aggregate demand. I noted earlier that the medium-term projection for real GDP in the September Tealbook is modestly more guarded than we had estimated in June; the same is true relative to July, only more so.  Much of the downward revision to the growth of GDP over the medium term is attributable to a higher expected exchange value of the dollar.  A small additional revision reflects a more subdued projected path for house prices in this forecast, and the balance reflects a smattering of other factors. The next three panels in your summary exhibit show recent and prospective labor improvement has been a little slower than we had expected.  On the household side, the unemployment rate—shown in panel 2—was 6.1 percent in August, a tenth and a half higher than in our July projection.  Moreover, the weaker profile of GDP growth that I mentioned earlier yields a slower decline in the unemployment rate from here forward.  By the end of the medium-term projection in 2017, the trajectory of the unemployment rate is 0.4 percentage point higher than in the July Tealbook.  Nonetheless, as before, we still have the unemployment rate moving a little below its natural rate toward the end of the projection period, albeit to a smaller degree.  And, as you can see from the thin red line, our latest projection is back very close to where we were in June, with the unemployment rate reaching its natural rate in mid-2016. On the establishment side, the level of total payrolls in August—panel 3—was about 170,000 lower than our previous projection.  We think the weakness in the see the news as having been a little worse than expected.  And, as you can see in panel 3, our latest forecast for payroll employment is a little softer than in both June and July, but still well above the trajectory we anticipated in September 2012, when you first tied your asset purchase decisions to an improvement in the labor market outlook.  In fact, the projected level of total payrolls in the fourth quarter of this year remains 1¾ million above our September 2012 projection. As one way of broadly summarizing the current state of the labor market, panel 4 plots the latest estimate from our labor market conditions index, or LMCI.  Even   48 of 232\f",
      "taking the recent payroll numbers at face value, as the statistical apparatus does, the LMCI slowed noticeably, on average, over the past two months but still managed to eke out a small gain. The last two panels of the exhibit summarize the inflation outlook.  As shown in panel 5, our projection for total PCE inflation in the second half of this year is lower now than it was at the time of your last meeting, largely as a result of a lower projected path for consumer energy prices.  In addition, the data on core PCE inflation—panel 6—have come in a little lower than expected since the July round.  Tomorrow morning, the BLS will provide one more last bit of information for you to take into account, when they publish their estimate of August CPI prices.  In 2015 and beyond, the core inflation forecast is just a touch lower than we had it in July, mostly reflecting the wider margin of labor and product market slack in this projection.  As in previous Tealbooks, therefore, we expect core inflation to increase slowly over the projection period, rising from 1.5 percent this year to 1.8 percent in 2017.  Headline PCE inflation is expected to run about one-tenth below the core over the medium term, reflecting a relatively flat projected path for consumer energy prices. Finally, I would draw your attention to my favorite section of the Tealbook—namely, the alternative scenarios that we provided in the back of the book—and I’d like to highlight two of those scenarios in particular.  The first, which we labeled “No Room to Grow,” contemplates a more pessimistic constellation of circumstances on the supply side of the economy, not altogether dissimilar to the view that Robert Gordon has been articulating lately.  In particular, we contemplate the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment is 1 percentage point higher than in the baseline, and that potential GDP growth is ¾ to 1 percentage point slower than in the baseline.  To be sure, this is not a pleasant world in which to be a policymaker, but the implications are manageable:  The unemployment rate—which is therefore already a little below its natural rate—drifts down a little further before turning back up.  Inflation rises to 2¼ percent over the next several years.  In all, the deviations from your goal variables are roughly similar to the ones that we project in the baseline—but with the opposite signs. A happier scenario, labeled “Higher Trend Labor Force Participation Rate,” assesses the possibility that there may be more cyclical weakness in the LFPR than we’ve allowed for in the baseline.  This view is not the central estimate of the research presented at the Brookings Institution by our labor team but is reminiscent of the possibility pointed out in a research paper last year by Erceg and Levin.  In this case, the unemployment rate runs a bit above baseline as the unanticipated reflow of participants swells the workforce.  GDP grows more quickly than in the baseline, and monetary policy can afford to be more accommodative to crowd in the aggregate demand necessary to absorb the larger workforce. Both of these alternative scenarios strike me as quite plausible possibilities.  And, following the advice of the ancients, we’ve tried to steer a middle course between these two outcomes.  Steve will now continue our presentation.   49 of 232\n",

      "MR. KAMIN.5  As you know, the upcoming Scottish referendum has roiled international markets and given impetus to independence movements around the world.  In fact, staff members in the International Finance Division are agitating to split off their write-up of the international outlook into its own separate Tealbook, as well as to replace the toadying director the Board has foisted on them with a democratically elected leader of their own choosing.  [Laughter]  Fortunately, the breakaway sections of the division have continued to comply with their forecasting obligations despite these distractions, and our forecast of the foreign economies is shown on panel 1 of your exhibit in the handout labeled “Material for the Foreign Outlook.” We estimate that total foreign economic growth, the black line, edged up to an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the second quarter and jumped to a 3 percent rate, near its historical trend pace, in the current quarter.  This path is little changed from the Starting with the emerging market economies, the blue line, back in July, we already had data pointing to a sharp rebound from the first-quarter pothole, with Chinese GDP surging to near an 8 percent rate in the second quarter.  Since then, second-quarter growth for Mexico has printed at 4¼ percent, well above our expectations, and more recent indicators confirm our view that Mexico has finally broken out from more than a year of subpar performance.  However, this good news has been marred by data for Brazil, where GDP now appears to have fallen through the first half of the year.  Moreover, data that came in over the weekend suggest that Chinese growth will slow to around a 7 percent rate in the second half of the year, below the 7½ percent number we wrote down last Wednesday in the Tealbook. Data for the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the solid green line, have also been a mixed bag.  In response to the April consumption tax hike, Japanese GDP tanked at an annual rate of 7.1 percent in the second quarter, much steeper than we were expecting.  The subsequent resumption of Japanese growth explains why both AFE growth and total foreign economic growth shift up in the current quarter, but, even so, recent indicators suggest that the rebound in Japanese GDP has been tepid.  More worrisomely, as indicated in panel 2, euro-area GDP stalled in the second quarter.  Some transitory factors were at work here, but the underlying momentum of the economy looks disturbingly weak.  All told, we would have marked down the near-term path of AFE growth considerably in this round, except that second-quarter Canadian growth proved stronger than expected, and Canada has a large share in our trade-weighted foreign aggregate. Looking ahead, foreign growth edges up just a bit further over the forecast period.  The emerging market economies benefit from strengthening activity in the United States and Europe, although this is tempered somewhat by a mild deceleration in China.  Growth in the AFEs is fairly stable over the period as improvement in the euro area is offset by a moderation to a more sustainable pace of expansion in Canada                                                  5 The materials used by Mr. Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).   50 of 232\f",
      "and the United Kingdom.  Nevertheless, even a 2 percent pace of economic growth is enough to substantially erode remaining economic slack in the AFEs. The litany of risks attending this reasonably benign forecast is well known to you:  renewed stresses in EMEs, financial disruptions in China, and escalation of the crisis in Ukraine.  Today I’d like to focus on another risk that has captured our attention and, notably, that of the ECB as well:  the risk of the euro area entering a protracted period of further disinflation and stagnant economic activity.  To be sure, as described in the Tealbook, we don’t consider this to be the most likely scenario.  First, as shown in panel 3, although headline inflation in the euro area, the black line, plunged to only 0.3 percent in August, this primarily reflects declines in food and energy prices; core inflation has moved sideways for the past year, albeit at a low level.  Second, much of the fall in food and energy prices actually took place last year but is still showing through to the 12-month headline inflation rate.  Measured on a quarter-to-quarter basis, as shown in panel 4, headline inflation has already been picking up for several quarters.  In consequence, food and energy prices merely need to stay flat in the coming quarters for headline inflation on a 12-month basis to start rising, and that impetus should be reinforced as waning fiscal drag and more stimulative monetary policy support a resumption of economic growth. Nevertheless, we cannot discount the possibility that the disinflation observed to date has already done damage by pushing down inflation expectations, the blue line in panel 5, helping to undermine business confidence, the red line, and contributing to startling declines in nominal bond yields, the green line.  These developments appear to have shaken the ECB’s confidence, leading it at its June and September meetings to announce the rate cuts, longer-term loans (TLTROs) to banks, and private asset purchases discussed by Simon this morning.  These steps have already helped depreciate the euro and should encourage some additional lending at the margin, but their overall effect will likely be limited.  This can be seen by comparing the solid lines in panels 2 and 4, which show our baseline projections of output and inflation taking the recently announced measures into account, with the dashed blue lines, which represent our view of how these variables would evolve in the absence of these measures. Accordingly, were the economy and prices to come under significant further pressure, the ECB would have to reach for the most obvious remaining tool in its arsenal, large-scale sovereign bond purchases.  As indicated by the dotted red lines in panels 2 and 4, if the ECB added €1 trillion in sovereign bond purchases to its already announced measures, this would appreciably boost GDP growth without pushing inflation above target.  However, due to the institution’s doctrinal concerns about financing government deficits, the “big bazooka” will most likely be used only if the economy substantially underperforms our baseline projection. Compared with the ECB, the Bank of England’s quandary is enviable—when to start normalizing policy in response to robust growth.  Like the Fed, the Bank of England is struggling to assess how much slack remains when unemployment is falling rapidly, as shown in panel 6, but wage growth has been subdued, panel 7.  For   51 of 232\f",
      "the Bank of England, this assessment is especially complicated because productivity, shown in panel 8, has remained so depressed.  Low productivity growth could be the explanation for low wage growth, implying there may be less slack in labor markets than some might believe.  Conversely, depressed productivity may give rise to a future rebound, in which case the economy may have more running room before inflationary pressures emerge.  Splitting the difference between these alternatives, the Bank of England’s latest forecast, which is predicated on a market path of expected interest rates that lifts off early next year and rises gradually thereafter, shows continued solid output growth and a rise in inflation toward its 2 percent target.  We think it likely that, if the economy evolves as projected, the Bank’s policy rate will indeed follow the market’s expected path. Of course, the bank’s monetary policy strategy could well be upset by Thursday’s Scottish independence referendum.  A “yes” vote would mean disruptions to British financial markets, confidence, and spending.  This probably wouldn’t substantially affect the aggregate foreign outlook, but it would certainly mean protracted negotiations on a host of difficult issues, including the choice of currency, provision of a lender-of-last-resort facility for Scotland’s large banks, and the disposition of responsibility for the U.K.’s public debt. Turning to panel 1 of your second and last exhibit, as Simon has discussed, the Scottish referendum, prospects for more monetary accommodation abroad, and heightened market focus on policy normalization in the United States have all pushed up the dollar in recent months, especially against the currencies of the AFEs.  For the period ahead, as shown in panel 2, we expect the dollar to rise a bit further against the AFEs as U.S. interest rates rise a bit faster than markets currently expect.  However, a depreciation of the dollar against EME currencies, especially China’s, leads the broad dollar index to decline over the forecast period, providing support to U.S. exports.  \n",

      "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Another one that would be interesting to consider is, what happens if this decline in oil prices continues?  The fact is, U.S. oil and gas liquids production is continuing to rise very rapidly.  I was looking at the EIA projections that came out earlier this month.  They’re projecting a further increase in output of 1.2 million barrels a day in 2015.  If you want to put that in context, at the start of 2012, we were producing 9½ million barrels of crude oil and gas liquids.  By the end of 2015, it’s going to be 14 million barrels.  That’s a pretty big increase in a pretty short time.  And if you go back and look at what the forecasts were back in 2006–07, the trend was flatter or declining.  So this is a huge gap relative to what people anticipated.  If geopolitical trends break in a more positive direction rather than a more negative direction, you can certainly see the possibility of energy prices coming down significantly.   What does all of this imply for monetary policy?  Well, it seems to me that we’re on the course that we thought we were on.  The only difference for me is that, at the July meeting, I could see how a March 2015 tightening might be very much in the cards if the payroll employment trends stayed firm, the unemployment rate continued to decline, and inflation continued to drift back up toward 2 percent.  Because none of those trends seem quite as clearly in place today as they were a few months ago, to me, a March tightening seems to be less likely. Given that, there doesn’t seem to be a big gap between our views as expressed in the SEP and the market consensus, especially, as the staff has mentioned, when you adjust for the fact that the SEP is a modal view and the market expectations are really a mean view, with some probability placed on no liftoff at all or a liftoff that’s aborted.  I don’t think we have a problem with expectations concerning the likely timing of liftoff.  So I don’t think we need to push one   107 of 232\f",

      "MR. FISCHER.  If I could drop in a story, which probably I’m not allowed to, I was once writing a book with a colleague, Rudi Dornbusch, who is, unfortunately, no longer with us.  I was at Stanford, and Rudi used to come out for a week every now and then.  People would say to him, “How long are you here?”  And he would say, “I’m going back to America tomorrow.”  [Laughter]  But it’s encouraging, actually, to hear what you said about California. On economic growth and the dual mandate, the staff has raised the forecast for the second half of this year and actually raised the forecast for the first half of this year—this is relative to the Tealbook—by a not inconsiderable 0.2 percentage point following receipt of the data from the QSS and a revision of retail sales data for June and July.  They did this without changing their forecast for fourth-quarter growth or forecasts for future years. Now, part of the economic growth forecast is based on the current account remaining, by historical standards, strong, in part due to a pickup in foreign growth and in part due to an assumption that the dollar, which has strengthened sharply in the past year, will weaken in the years ahead.  Given the difficulty of forecasting the exchange rate, I would regard that element of the forecast as more uncertain than most and share the concerns about foreign growth that we just heard from, I think, President Williams.  I would add to that that Chinese growth looks a good deal less certain than it did a few years ago. There’s been a lot of attention lately to secular stagnation, the rate of productivity growth, the rate of technical progress, et cetera.  On the one hand, we have Larry Summers talking about secular stagnation, which he sees as a demand-side problem—namely, that the equilibrium real interest rate is negative, and that, without creating bubbles, booms, and other dubious sources of growth, we’re going to have trouble maintaining full employment and economic growth.  That’s very dramatic, and there are some people who prefer to be dramatic.   109 of 232\f",
      "But there is another view, which is basically taken into account in the Tealbook, and that’s that there’s been a significant slowdown in technical progress.  You can have Bob Hall and Bob Gordon on one side—Bob Gordon explaining why everything that was worth discovering has been discovered and Joel Mokyr, his colleague at Northwestern University, explaining why many wonderful things await us when we have the next few breakthroughs.  I’m on the Mokyr side, but that’s just a matter of temperament, I think.  It’s clear that the rate of productivity growth has declined since 2006, and the staff estimates that trend multifactor productivity growth was just ¾ percent from 2010 to 2013.  In their projections, they’re assuming multifactor productivity growth of about 1 percent a year for the years 2015 to 2017.  So they’re not on the high side of this thing, and they’re not injecting excess optimism into the forecast. Now, one can ask, does it make any difference to monetary policy?  After all, we look at the unemployment rate.  Well, it’s still above where we’d like it to be.  We look at the inflation rate.  That’s still below where we’d like it to be.  Then we can just turn to the Taylor rule, and there we are—we can leave all of those arguments aside.  But if you look at page 60 of the Tealbook, Book A, as well as at the forecast and the assumptions that David Wilcox was emphasizing—you see the “No Room to Grow” scenario, which is red, and you’ll see that having a slowdown in productivity growth is a big problem.  In the macroeconomy, we get the lower growth, obviously.  We also have a higher unemployment rate, and, using our standard monetary policy tools, have a higher federal funds rate because we also have a higher inflation rate.  That picture is a very unsatisfactory one, as David told us.  On the other hand, if we got more labor force participation, that looks like an unambiguously good thing, from the viewpoint of the economy as a whole.  Actually, it mirrors, not exactly but not far off, the opposite of technical progress.  So these things really matter to us, not in the sense that we have to go out there and try   110 of 232\f",
      "to affect them—that’s not our job, other than to the extent that we keep policy appropriate—but it is something we need to take into account and then remember that we’ll call that a headwind if that slowdown in productivity growth continues. that besets our forecasts.  I personally feel quite uncomfortable being asked to give forecasts for the federal funds rate for 2017, because I think the uncertainty about what that rate will be is massive and is no less important—possibly it’s even more important—than our expectation of what the rate itself will be.  If we’re going to talk to the public, we need to continue to emphasize the high level of uncertainty that accompanies all of our forecasts, and we’d better tell savers, investors, and anyone else who’s thinking about the future that they have to take uncertainty into account in making their decisions.  We tend not do that, although, as somebody remarked earlier, the Chair has done a very good job of telling people about uncertainty not only in the press conference, but also in recent speeches. Well, to sum up, we are now—although we don’t seem to want to say that—relatively close to the attainment of the goals of the dual mandate.  But, as a result of what had to be done to prevent a second Great Depression, we still face monetary policy decisions of great importance and monetary policy decisions that lack precedent.  And that’s what we’re going to have to talk about later today, perhaps. \n",

      "MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  Recent data confirm that the economy is on a moderate expansion path, with labor market conditions continuing to improve.  Inflation has stabilized, and downside risks to inflation appear to have dissipated. In thinking about the statement, I focused on the two key clauses that you mentioned yesterday, Madam Chair—“significant underutilization of labor resources” and “considerable time.”  Regarding the former, although the labor market has shown substantial improvement over the past year, the degree of slack has not materially changed since our last meeting, and it remains significant.  Based on my own staff’s analysis, and consistent with many other estimates, my estimate of the medium-term natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent, well below the prevailing unemployment rate of 6.1 percent.  And again, looking at other indicators of labor market strength, taken together, yields the same conclusion. Turning to our forward guidance regarding the funds rate liftoff, I view the economic outlook as essentially unchanged from June, and it remains appropriate to signal a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate, unchanged from our last meeting.  Removing or weakening the “considerable time” guidance in paragraph 5 at this time would send a misleading and counterproductive signal that we intend to tighten policy relatively soon.  Therefore, for this meeting, I strongly support keeping the language in alternative B. Like others, I am thinking ahead to the next meeting.  With our asset purchases almost surely coming to an end in October, we will need to review the most effective way to provide forward guidance.  My prepared remarks echo many of those of President Lockhart, but I will go through them nevertheless.  And to cut to the chase, I view the current structure of paragraph 5—the paragraph around our forward guidance—as providing a robust and flexible structure for the   146 of 232\f",
      "next phases of our forward guidance.  In my view, the language of paragraph 5 works because it makes it clear that our policy decisions depend on economic data and progress toward achieving the dual mandate.  That is, it is a data-based policy.  The second sentence of paragraph 5 states that the decision regarding liftoff will be based on the Committee’s assessment of progress toward meeting the dual mandate.  And the third sentence links that assessment to an array of data regarding labor market conditions, inflation, and financial developments, thereby emphasizing the data dependence. Another point that I want to emphasize is that these sentences encompass a variety of approaches to monetary policy.  Whether you think about it in terms of optimal control or versions of the Taylor rules, or other ways you think about forming monetary policy, these sentences link our policy decisions to our goal variables and the progress we’re making to them.  The language also, importantly, echoes and links to the language of our longer-run goals and policy strategy statement. Of course, I recognize that some around the table are concerned about the final sentence in paragraph 5 that describes the Committee’s assessment of the timing of liftoff.  The “considerable time” phrase may leave the impression of our decision being time-dependent, and all of us who have signed that a time-dependent policy is not a good one are going to spend time in central bank purgatory over our various time-dependent forward guidance of the last few years.  I recognize that.  But, again, I would emphasize that paragraph 5, as it is written today and as it should continue to be written, is not a time-based description of how we approach policy.  It is not like, in my view, the statements that we put out in 2011 and 2012.  Instead, the final sentence of paragraph 5 attempts to distill the Committee’s judgment on the implications of the data for existing and expected progress on our dual-mandate objectives, which is then   147 of 232\f",
      "translated into a view on our current and expected policy stances.  The time dimension of the sentence is clearly tied to the expected evolution of the economy.  In a sense, it provides the desired, and, to my mind, the necessary forward guidance based on the Committee’s expectations of future actions and economic conditions.  And I think this approach is flexible.  As economic conditions improve and we reach the point of being near liftoff, clearly the word “considerable” can be replaced by “some.”  Eventually, once we are well away from the zero lower bound, forward guidance of this type may not be needed at all. In conclusion, I acknowledge that this might not be a perfect approach, but I am skeptical that we will be able to do better.  One idea that has been out there, which I think is a constructive proposal but that still has some issues, is trying to replace this sentence with some notion about our inflation forecasts over the next year or two.  My observation on this—and again, I am echoing, I think, some of the comments of President Lockhart—is that there is some type of Heisenberg uncertainty principle that seems to apply to threshold-based language.  That is, as soon as you put it out there, the behavior of that variable changes in a way that undermines the use of that variable for forward guidance.  I think our experience with the rapid decline of the unemployment rate—which did not seem, in my own view, and I think other people’s views, to be consistent with the actual underlying improvement in the labor market—created some communication problems for us, that, basically, the unemployment rate fell below 6½ percent much faster than we thought the labor market actually improved.  I think the Bank of England has also experienced similar problems with their short-lived forward guidance.  I think having forward guidance potentially based on the inflation forecast, or trying to distill all of our views about policy onto that one variable, does increase the risk that that variable’s behavior could possibly move away from being the summary statistic for policy decisions that we thought it was   148 of 232\f",
      "in advance.  So, again, I am skeptical that such an approach would be better than what we have The last point I would like to make, as long as we are at or near the zero lower bound, is that I think it would be a mistake to abandon forward guidance entirely—just remove that sentence.  Given the unusual state of monetary policy over the past seven years, letting the public make up their own minds as to what our intentions are would likely lead to confusion that would be detrimental to the achievement of our policy goals.  Of course, in the long run, our goal is to help people understand what our reaction function is and let markets figure out on their own what we are likely to do.  But, given that we have been at the zero lower bound doing unconventional policy for so many years, I think that is unrealistic—or, it is “a bridge too far”—right now, and I think the forward guidance needs to be with us for some time yet.

      "MR. LACKER.  I want to talk a little bit about the pressure on rates in the couple of days before quarter-end.  MarketSource provides a great set of descriptive information about what was going on in markets after our announcement.  And it was pretty clear that after the announcement of our parameters, people placed a lot of weight on the probability that the RRP rate would be set below 5 basis points.  The description led me to believe that people are essentially taking out insurance by locking up funds over that horizon and were willing to take a lower yield now on, say, five-day funds across the quarter-end in order to insure against maybe even getting a negative rate at the RRP.  Now, at a five-day horizon, that’s just a traditional sort of yield curve consideration. Before, when we pegged the funds rate, it was the only rate we pegged.  Now we do peg the IOER rate, and we’re going to smooth that through the quarter-end.  The IOER rate isn’t going to move over quarter-end.  So what we’re talking about is this spread to IOER.  If rates are going to be soft in the days leading into year-end, isn’t the natural response for us to raise the cap at year-end, so we’re sure we can nail the rate at 5 basis points?  And if we do that and markets are pretty confident that the cap we have for year-end—and this is one of the staff’s proposals—is going to nail it, then we’re not going to get the softness in the days ahead.  So I’m not sure why that’s not the best option for this. Now, I understand that the Committee, in its discussion of the cap on the overall size of the facility, came to a judgment that reflected a variety of considerations about the footprint, financial-stability concerns, the idea of people running into this facility, and so forth.  Well, if that judgment leads us to want to leave the cap in place at year-end, then my understanding is that these term RRPs are not going to count against this cap.  So they are sort of an end run around the cap; they are sort of loosening up the Committee’s decision about $300 billion being 37 of 258\f",

We have generally lived with a fair amount of year-end volatility and haven’t viewed it as problematic until now.  Now I understand the consideration about the end of June. \n",

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Economic conditions in the Eighth District have been mixed since our previous meeting.  Anecdotal reports are generally upbeat concerning shipments, sales, and commercial real estate.  Contacts in the transportation industry expect to be operating near capacity due to a large fall harvest, increased imports, and e-commerce holiday sales growth.  The growth in transportation and e-commerce activity has also helped fuel a boom in industrial construction.  In the farm sector, our contacts reported record yields for corn and soybeans and near-record yields for rice.  This year, about half the nation’s rice crop will come from Arkansas, the highest share ever. Labor market and residential housing data were generally weaker than in previous months.  The District’s unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent but remained higher than the unemployment rate in the nation as a whole.  Residential construction remains soft, but construction in the multifamily segment has shown considerable growth.  Some of our contacts think that multifamily construction may decline in 2015 because many projects have already been completed.  Employment in the health care services sector, which is a relatively large part of the District’s economy, has continued to decline in recent months.  This is a trend that we will watch carefully in the months and quarters ahead. Turning to the national outlook, the St. Louis Fed’s financial stress index increased during the intermeeting period as global markets apparently priced in a slower global economic growth outlook.  This repricing was driven in part by a very gloomy IMF meeting here in Washington and by weaker-than-expected data from Europe, including a sharp downward revision in German growth prospects. Indeed, in preparation for this meeting my staff looked at the Eurocoin GDP data.  Eurocoin is a real-time cyclical indicator for the euro area constructed using 73 of 258\f",
      "1,000 macroeconomic time series from the major countries of the euro area.  We saw a little bit of it earlier from the staff.  Its most recent value is the lowest in a year.  My staff constructed a simple regime switching model to estimate the probability that Europe is in recession based on this data.  The main finding is that the estimated probability that Europe is in recession as of any point in the past when the recession probability has reached this level, Europe actually was in recession.  While certainly far from definitive, I take this type of result as suggestive of a real risk that Europe had reentered a recession state or will enter into such a state shortly. The Europe-in-recession story seemed to get an extra boost in financial markets when many began to argue that the United States would also suffer from slower-than-expected growth or even outright recession.  This argument was, in my opinion, a bridge too far.  The U.S. macroeconomic outlook remains fairly robust.  Our tracking estimates for real GDP remain at  3 percent for the second half of 2014, and the St. Louis forecast continues to project 3 percent growth in 2015.  Labor market data, including revisions to previous months, have been encouraging.  Unemployment claims are extraordinarily low, and consumer confidence is at a post-recession high.  I expect the unemployment rate to continue to fall in coming jobs reports, moving into the central tendency of the Committee’s estimate of the longer-run normal rate in the first half of next year.  At the current pace, unemployment may be well below 5 percent by this time next year. In addition to relatively strong U.S. data and a good outlook for 2015, two factors should provide an important tailwind.  One is that recent global financial turmoil left longer-term U.S. interest rates lower: the 10-year Treasury rate is trading around 228 basis points this morning.  Lower longer-term rates are normally an important bullish factor for U.S. growth prospects.  In 74 of 258\f",
      "addition, the dramatic fall in oil prices should put additional cash in the pockets of U.S. consumers and cut costs for U.S. producers.  This, too, is a bullish factor for U.S. economic growth. Given these considerations, I have not changed my outlook for the appropriate path of the policy rate.  I continue to expect macroeconomic developments, as I have outlined them, to push the Committee toward a somewhat earlier liftoff than commonly assumed.  The outlook I have just described is somewhat more optimistic than the marked-down path for GDP described in the Tealbook baseline.  In my view, the current Tealbook baseline overemphasizes possible effects through dollar appreciation.   I do not think that we can reliably predict exchange rate movements, at least not to the point at which the Committee can rely on these forecasts for a major part of its policy strategy, and in this respect I agree with President Fisher’s earlier comments.  Indeed, the staff has been revamping its dollar forecast models, and we have little experience with the new methodology.  Also, I have long regarded the empirical evidence concerning the effects of exchange rate movements on important macroeconomic variable as extraordinarily weak.  Thus, even if we could gain some confidence in a particular path for the dollar, the real implications are only estimated with a very large confidence band.  And finally, the changing nature of global production, as hinted at earlier by President Lockhart, has likely altered the interpretation of any empirical evidence we do have.  Factory location, in particular, has changed dramatically since the 1980s, a factor that I am not convinced has been appropriately incorporated into the empirical work in this area that I have seen. This leaves me with a relatively optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy, and this is the same outlook I described in my interview with Bloomberg on October 16.  However, there is a 75 of 258\f",
      "problem with the story as I have it.  Presumably, expected inflation should be rising or staying constant in this environment, but some measures of expected inflation are falling.  Indeed, the TIPS-based five-year breakeven inflation rate has declined about 60 basis points since the July–range.  The two-year is in the 120 to 125 basis point range.  If we subtract out the difference between CPI and PCE inflation, which my staff puts at 30 to 35 basis points, one could interpret the market as suggesting that PCE inflation will be perhaps 1.1 percent or 1.2 percent over the next five years.  I know there are subtleties in this calculation, but this is roughly true, provided investors are close to risk neutral. This level of expected inflation concerns me because I regard expected inflation as one of the primary determinants of actual inflation and because, in my view, the Committee should be able to attain its inflation target over a period as long as five years.  Even an expected inflation rate of 1.1 or 1.2 percent over five years may not be that bad, but the direction is concerning.  These expectations have been falling since the summer.  I know longer-term five-year, five-year-forward inflation expectations are more stable, but that’s far in the future.  That’s just a measure, in my mind, of the ultimate credibility of the Committee.  As I was saying earlier, I don’t think those expectations should ever change.  Still, I think we should be able to hit our inflation target over a period as long as five years. Undoubtedly, the drop in inflation expectations in the recent data has been wrapped up in the deteriorating global growth outlook.  Nevertheless, it’s important that U.S. monetary policy remains nimble enough to react to changing macroeconomic circumstances, if necessary.  This is the source of my suggestion that the Committee could use its state-contingent clause regarding tapering at this time.  After all, we have stated repeatedly that policy is not on a preset path.  76 of 258\f",
      "Unfortunately, I think that despite our best efforts, financial markets do think that policy is on a preset path and that deviations from that path would require such dramatic changes in the incoming data as to be all but impossible. Would recent events meet such a high-bar criterion?  That is, is this a major macroeconomic event?  I think that the specter of renewed recession in Europe is an important macroeconomic development.  If this had led to further declines in inflation expectations via continued market turmoil, the Committee might have exercised this state-contingent option at this meeting, possibly with an important effect.  As events have actually unfolded, inflation expectations have stabilized for now, but at an uncomfortably low level.  I think that this is sufficient for us to go ahead and complete the tapering process at this meeting.  I will provide further comments on this in the policy go-round.  Thank you, Madam Chair. \n",

      "MS. GEORGE.  While the stronger dollar and weaker foreign growth may tend to damp U.S. growth, I see the decline in both oil prices and longer-term interest rates providing a countervailing impetus to economic growth. Fundamental indicators of employment and production remain solid, and I remain encouraged, like others, by recent labor market developments.  For example, the decline in the unemployment rate this year has been almost entirely due to increases in household employment rather than declining labor force participation as in previous years, and job openings are at a 13-year high with the number of unemployed workers per job opening down to 2, its lowest level since the recession.  Looking across these and a host of other labor market indicators, the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators registered another increase in the level of activity in September and continued strong momentum near its historical high.  The level of activity was the highest since October 2008 when the unemployment rate was 6.5 percent, and for the past six months the momentum indicator has remained at high levels relative to what can be considered normal. wage rates. Finally, my staff recently looked at wage growth among jobs switchers, as reported by ADP.  This is potentially an important signal about the extent to which businesses are competing more aggressively to attract existing workers away from their current employers.  Based on the ADP data, wage growth for these workers has risen from 4 percent to 5.3 percent over the past 18 months as the quit rate has increased from 1.5 to 1.8.  As more workers voluntarily seek alternative employment and employers compete to hire them, the wages of job switchers are rising at a faster pace.  I expect this trend to continue and increasingly to put pressure on overall 103 of 258\f",
      "Turning to inflation, I expect to see some softness in the near term due to the stronger dollar and lower oil prices.  And although the recent decline in longer-term inflation expectations as measured by the five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate bears watching, survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain well anchored.  As the unemployment rate is expected to fall to its natural rate by late 2015 and longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, it seems reasonable to assume that inflation will move toward the 2 percent target.

      "MR. FISHER.  Well, first, Madam Chair—RIP, QE3.  I am thrilled that we are ending this program, as you know, and I hope it does rest in peace.  Time will tell, depending on how we manage our exit over time.  I pray that it will rest in peace permanently. With regard to alternative B, first, I’m very pleased that in this draft we dropped what I consider to be risky references to financial conditions.  I really believe that’s wise, particularly from the standpoint of avoiding the risk of developing the notion of what I call a “Yellen put.”  The Vice Chairman and Governor Fischer referred to that yesterday.  I hope you’ll recall that Governor Stein and I long ago argued the need for volatility to resume, although obviously you don’t want to see extreme out-of-control volatility, or one-day volatility like we did.  But I think we don’t wish to look like nervous Nellies because we have seen some long-overdue volatility or because of a market correction, which I have, as you know, repeatedly warned as a distinct possibility. Although the statement, as written, is far from ideal from my personal perspective, it is, without a doubt, an improvement over September’s statement.  In particular, paragraph 1, as you point out, no longer talks of significant underutilization of labor resources, but instead acknowledges that the underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing.  Paragraph 4 includes what I consider still to be the objectionable calendar guidance “considerable time” phrase that has been pointed out by Bill English and others.  It emphasizes more strongly than before that the timing of liftoff will depend on incoming data.  On these grounds, because I am on record as stating that it’s my policy to move on once I have registered an objection except when new grounds for objection arise, I will support option B at this meeting, unless the wording is changed during this meeting. 138 of 258\f",
      "That said, my remaining concern is the very last sentence of the statement.  I have used in speeches, and I think in this room, an analogy to duck hunting.  That is, you want to lead your mallard rather than aim right at it when you shoot.  Otherwise, you’re not going to bag it.  I worry that if we stick with the last sentence, as written, it could result in our overshooting, and then be followed by a tightening ex post that in every instance I know about historically has resulted in recession.  This is the conclusion of the Economic Letter that Evan Koenig—as the staff would say, exhibit 1, seated behind me—and I wrote recently.  I think it’s also in keeping with the sentiment you expressed in your most recent speech in Jackson Hole.  I would urge us to reexamine that last sentence at our next meeting. Let me add just one last comment.  I am very skeptical about the Tealbook policy simulations.  Built into the inflation forecast is the assumption that long-term expectations are anchored at 1¾ percent, which holds down the trajectory of inflation over the next couple of years by approximately ¼ percentage point.  Also, the simulations don’t reflect or acknowledge the recessionary momentum that kicks in once the unemployment rate begins to rise. One last comment.  In my opinion, the Tealbook, Book B, optimal policy simulations on rate path today—which at least the copy I have in front of me is showing in that red line in the top left-hand box—is markedly different from the one calculated in September, because the optimal policy is very sensitive to changes in economic conditions.  Given the sensitivity, I don’t want to be locked into a particular timing of liftoff or pace of subsequent rate increases.  You don’t want to give the impression that only a big change in the outlook will get you to change course, which is why I consider “considerable time” as having been, and continuing to be, a bad idea.  I believe that we need to consider this in December.  If economic conditions improve 139 of 258\f",
      "between now and then, that will certainly condition my vote then.  But for now, Madam Chair, I support alternative B.

The trimmed mean is calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and is 1.65 percent.  Thank you very much. \n",

      "MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the action in alternative B today.  The forecast for the economy is largely unchanged since the September meeting.  There has been substantial improvement in labor markets since the asset purchase program was announced in I can also support the language in alternative B today.  Although some aspects of the statement still concern me, I welcome some of the changes in language.  In general, I believe the characterization of the economy in the statement should not be just a recitation of movements in the data since the previous meeting, but an indication of the Committee’s view of the implications of changes in the data for the economic outlook and progress toward our goals and, therefore, for policy.  I actually thought that the draft statement language circulated before the Tealbook, Book B, got us closer to this ideal.  Nevertheless, the suggested change in the characterization of labor markets in paragraph 1 seems consistent with the improvement we’ve been seeing for some time and supports ending the purchase program.  In paragraph 2, I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that near-term inflation will be held down by the drop in energy prices, but that our consensus outlook of inflation rising gradually back to target remains intact. In contrast to President Fisher, I would have preferred that we include some reference to financial market volatility in paragraph 1 along with our evaluation that overall financial market conditions remain highly supportive of economic growth.  The volatility has been front and center in the minds of the public, and I believe it would be appropriate for us to give our interpretation of what it means for the outlook.  Moreover, although we have signaled an end to the purchases, I could imagine the end of the program will still be met with some volatility, as 147 of 258\f",
      "intermeeting volatility we have seen might help them assess our likely reaction to volatility of this type in the future. In our forward guidance on the path of interest rates, the addition of the two new sentences provides some welcome emphasis that our policy is state contingent.  I personally would still prefer that we remove the reference to “considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program.”  Leaving it in poses problems for our forward guidance at subsequent meetings, especially if the intention is to continue to use the end of the purchase program as the benchmark, even as that event recedes increasingly into the past.  This is one of the suggestions in the staff memo on forward guidance, but it would not be my preference.  On this issue, I agree with President Lockhart. I don’t believe there is any economic rationale for tying liftoff to the end of the purchase program, and doing so seems to link the timing of liftoff to that particular event rather than to economic conditions.  In addition, continuing to use the end of the purchase program as our reference state would muddy our communications.  For example, suppose, for the sake of argument, liftoff is to occur next June, which we are going to characterize as a “considerable time from the end of the purchase program.”  Such guidance would technically be correct next forward guidance in May.  It would be very misleading.  So we would need to change the benchmark at some point well before liftoff.   My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the conclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance, replace “considerable time” with a more generic “a time.”  And if there is concern that the public will misinterpret the change in guidance, we should include a sentence clarifying that the change in the Committee’s guidance 148 of 258\f",
      "doesn’t indicate a change in the Committee’s policy intentions.  If that is indeed the case, we should be able to point to the December SEP for confirmation of that.  There is precedent for this, as the Committee included such a sentence in March when it replaced the threshold forward guidance with the current formulation.  Thank you, Madam Chair. \n",

      "MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  Ending the asset purchase program is a positive step as the Committee looks ahead to policy normalization, and I support the statement as written. As the recent staff memo on the forward-guidance approach highlights, between now and the time of the first rate increase, we face some challenging communication to adjust our forward guidance.  The staff memo discussing the progression of guidance strikes me as a sensible and workable plan.  After liftoff, however, it seems to me that the special role for forward guidance at the zero lower bound argues for it to be retired and the communication returned to a focus on economic conditions, the forecast, and related risks.  In this regard, I found recent comments by the governor of the Bank of Canada instructive on forward guidance. Regarding the timing of liftoff, my preferred approach is to move in the second quarter of next year if the labor market continues to tighten and inflation makes progress in moving toward 2 percent.  Many of the policy rules already point to a tighter stance of policy.  And, while an accommodative stance of policy was certainly appropriate—on account of the constraint posed by the zero lower bound, as we were coming out of the crisis—if we lift off in June, we will have been below prescriptions advocated by the standard policy rules for more than a year.  While I don’t see events necessarily running ahead of our policy now, I do see a risk that economic conditions may warrant a more aggressive action down the line than markets are currently expecting.

      "MR. TETLOW.  There’s a reference in the full memo to a paper by Debortoli, Kim, Lindé, and Nunes.  They took the Smets-Wouters model and looked at what the optimal Ramsey policy was in there.  Then they said, what would the loss-function weight on the output gap be for the kind of loss functions that, for example, we use to carry out optimal control scenarios for the Committee?  It turns out that the coefficient in that case would be a coefficient of unity, which would actually be much higher in unemployment space.  This is one of these cases in which, once the model starts to get sufficiently complex, there are some more channels through which monetary policy works, and, more important, there are more shocks that break the “divine coincidence.”  Then you get the result in which a higher weight on resource utilization becomes appropriate. \n",

      "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My comments are going to strongly echo what’s already been said here, so I’ll be brief.   The consensus statement established an inflation target for the United States.  Therefore, it’s quite an important document for this Committee.  Previous to that, the FOMC did not have an official inflation target.  I think that establishing an inflation target has been quite valuable to the Committee during this era of very low inflation.  It could have gone very differently if there had been some doubt that maybe a large fraction of the Committee thought 1 percent inflation or 0 percent inflation was okay.  That could have led to very different dynamics for the U.S. economy.  So it’s actually been quite helpful to adopt the inflation target, as former Chairman Bernanke predicted at the time. My general feeling, echoing many of the previous comments, is that the statement does not require modification.  The statement is written in a way to garner widespread consensus around the table—I would not want to disturb that consensus.  I think that trying to change the consensus statement before we return to a more normalized policy environment—that is, this coming January—carries substantial risk of muddling our near-term policy intentions in the minds of financial market participants and the general public.  So I recommend no change. I have a few comments on specific issues that also echo the previous comments.  I regard the inflation target as symmetric, and I’ve said so publicly on many occasions.  Hitting the inflation target, on average, is closer to price-level targeting.  In this sense, it’s closer to optimal policy in many leading theories. I think the “balanced approach” language is brilliant and should not be altered.  It may seem fair to say that the weights on inflation and unemployment are equal or should be equal, but research on the topic suggests otherwise.  If you read the literature, the actual weights on the two 186 of 258\f",
      "objectives are going to depend on details of modeling assumptions, preferences, technology, and frictions that are in the model.  Those parameters are all going to come together in a way to determine what the right weights are on the two objectives from the point of view of household utility, as President Lacker was saying.  So it’s just not clear that it always comes out to be exactly equal.  That is something that seems as though it would be the right thing, but it’s not. As an example, I’ll point out a favorite paper I like to quote to all of you here—Ravenna and Walsh.  That’s a New Keynesian model with explicit search-theoretic unemployment in it.  You have the unemployment friction in there.  You have the sticky price friction in there.  You might have thought you were going to get roughly equal weights to balance the two frictions.  That isn’t what they got.  They got pretty heavy optimal weight on inflation.  That’s just the outcome of one piece of research, but I think the nature of research shows you that it’s not going to come out to be equal and it could go the other way.  It could be that other types of models with other types of assumptions would put heavy weight on the unemployment side and less weight on the price-stability side.  So it’s just not something that naturally falls out of models, at least in my experience.  Another example, one from the older research literature, is Rotemberg and Woodford, who calculated optimal weights in their model that certainly were not equal. On financial stability, I agree with the previous comments that this would be very difficult.  Anything beyond what’s in the existing consensus statement would be very difficult.  There’s a clear lack of consensus on models or even approach on this issue around the table.  It’s an issue of our time.  It’s a macroeconomic issue of first-order importance.  But I don’t think we have anything like the right approach or language to be able to put it into a statement of this kind.

      "MS. BRAINARD.  Since we last met, we’ve had two strong payroll reports, and American consumers are demonstrating more confidence both in their actions and in their expectations, bolstered, in part, by significantly lower prices at the pump.  These are very welcome developments.  But we also see the increasingly resilient growth in the United States taking place against a backdrop of considerable risks to the outlook in several important foreign economies, and the dollar has continued its sharp appreciation.  In addition, progress in moving inflation back up toward our target has been quite limited, even looking through the recent sharp drop in oil prices.  On balance, then, I would say that conditions continue to validate our strategy of ending asset purchases in October—this time for real, or so we hope—while remaining somewhat patient on the removal of monetary accommodation, even as we see the day of liftoff coming, I think, into clearer view. The news from the labor market has been unambiguously positive.  The unemployment rate has moved down further.  Payroll employment is now averaging above 280,000 per month.  And whereas previously nearly all of the take-up in slack was seen only in the overall unemployment rate, now we’re seeing other margins of slack also showing improvement.  The participation rate has been about flat since the spring, which is encouraging, given that we think there is an underlying trend of decline, and it suggests some cyclical improvement.  The number of employees working part time for economic reasons has moved noticeably lower in the past three months after remaining stubbornly high, and it’s also notable that most of the reduction in unemployment over the past year has been accounted for by a welcome and overdue reduction in long-term unemployment. But, of course, while we see evidence that labor market slack is diminishing across a number of dimensions, we don’t actually have very good measurements of how much slack 104 of 219\f",
      "remains.  Moreover, we see no clear evidence of a broad-based acceleration in wages.  We hear a lot of anecdotes.  There are some regional and skill-specific pressures, but all three of the measures that we traditionally look at on the aggregate measure of wages show increases from a year ago that are still mired in the 2 to 2¼ percent range, well below increases prior to the crisis and little different from the pace in recent years. The incoming data on aggregate spending, I think, reinforce the picture of solid underlying growth momentum in the domestic economy.  The data on consumer spending received after publication of the Tealbook suggest that second-half GDP is increasing at above a 3 percent pace, which is very welcome.  The continued low rates and the recent sharp declines in oil prices should continue to boost consumer spending into the next year, while also, on balance, providing a plus to business investment and output.  It’s also significant that potential disruptions to the fiscal-policy trajectory, which have damaged incipient recoveries previously, have been taken off the table, which removes a significant source of risk. One note of weakness, I think, on the domestic aggregate demand front is familiar.  We still see weakness in single-family housing, and the data that we saw this morning has single-family permits, the best gauge of activity in this sector, changing little again. Now, on the risk side, I think the inflation picture bears continued vigilance.  Even looking through the recent sharp declines in oil prices on the assumption they will stabilize and pass through to retail prices over the next two quarters, the level of inflation that might be expected to prevail seems to be centered around 1½ percent, below our target.  Although there are good reasons to expect inflation to move up toward the target as slack is eliminated, we haven’t seen any sustained movement in that direction thus far.  Taken together with the recent shift down in market-based indications of inflation expectations, this points to some downside 105 of 219\f",
      "risks in the inflation outlook, especially given the backdrop of falling commodity prices and disinflationary pressures abroad.  We also are seeing some financial risks from the big adjustments recently in the price of oil, and they bear watching, I think. It’s also important to recognize possible risks from a further deterioration in economic conditions abroad.  The intermeeting period saw further evidence of stagnation or weakening in economic activity in some of the largest foreign economies, further monetary accommodation or expectations of future easing in response, and a further notable increase in the dollar.  Realized and expected changes in foreign monetary policy arise in the context of continued underperformance in key foreign economies struggling with deflationary pressures, compounded in some cases by an unwillingness or inability to engage in meaningful fiscal support to domestic demand and ongoing and unresolved structural challenges.  Recent events in Greece remind us that although there has been notable progress, threats to financial stability in the euro area remain. Although the United States obviously has a very large and diversified internal market, this doesn’t imply that we are in any way a closed economy or immune from foreign shocks.  Connections between the United States and foreign markets are still extremely large in both directions, and recent experience tells us that financial market disturbances abroad can have very large effects on U.S. asset prices and on financial markets more generally. Due to the lag in the dollar’s effects on trade, net exports will likely continue to subtract from GDP growth over the medium term.  Moreover, I suspect that increases in the value of the dollar have not yet run their course.  Staff memos have noted that, on net, the effect of dollar appreciation on U.S. GDP growth can be expected to be relatively modest, but this net effect conceals two important and significant gross effects, an initial and substantial depressing effect 106 of 219\f",
      "of dollar increases on net exports and a subsequent, partially offsetting positive effect from a more-accommodative monetary policy.  If a strengthening dollar does weigh heavily on net exports, all else being equal, we will need to adjust the pace of normalization in response. The good news is that the U.S. economy and financial system have become more resilient over the past two years, and internal sources of demand seem sufficiently strong, particularly with the boost from low gas prices, to continue growth momentum in the face of headwinds from abroad.  But I would not lightly dismiss risks that those headwinds could intensify. Overall, when considering appropriate policy, I would place robust domestic demand growth in the context of a global environment of weak foreign aggregate demand and large persistent disinflationary pressures.  Such an environment, in my view, suggests that downside risks to U.S. growth remain, and, coupled with persistently weak core inflation below our target and some deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, it warrants a still cautious approach to policy normalization.

      "MR. ENGLISH.  I’m not sure.  I mean, we thought it was helpful to have the sentence saying that the Committee is not intending this to be a change in its forward guidance.  I think the question is, what did people understand the forward guidance to be in October?  I think that some in the markets think that that was basically “considerable time,” and they’re expecting a repetition of “considerable time.”  So by saying “considerable time following the end of its purchase program in October,” you’re pulling a little closer in time the point at which it may be appropriate to raise rates.

      "MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, although I have some comments regarding the wording of the statement that I’ll turn to in a minute. The recovery has picked up a great amount of steam.  Of course, inflation remains low, but, with remaining slack diminishing and commodity import prices likely stabilizing, I see inflation gradually returning to our objective.  The statement appropriately recognizes these developments and provides a smooth transition in preparation for liftoff sometime next year.  I continue, personally, to view a June 2015 liftoff as appropriate, but, of course, that’s entirely data dependent. The healthy tenor of recent economic data and business reports bolsters my confidence in the ongoing expansion.  Performance in the labor market has been especially impressive, and, after a long seven years in the wilderness, we’re probably only about a year away from finally reaching our goal of maximum employment. To be consistent with the unvarnished improvement in these labor market data, paragraph 1 of alternative B should omit the bracketed “somewhat,” in my view.  Including “somewhat” would be inconsistent with the very positive October–November labor market reports and other labor market indicators, as we discussed yesterday. Of course, a consequential change in statement language is the “patient” wording in paragraph 3, as President Lockhart mentioned, and my comments are actually going to follow very closely with the comments of President Lockhart.  The staff memo did lay out, I think nicely, how the statement could evolve from the word “patient” into the future.  I will mention that we’ve had two other staff memos over the past several months that explained how “considerable time” could very nicely play out through the future to “some time” and how “considerable time since October” could play out into the future very nicely.  I actually think all 126 of 219\f",
      "of these approaches represent reasonable bridges between now and liftoff, whenever that’s appropriate.   The main goal that we’re trying to achieve is basically not, in my view, to move market expectations around.  Market expectations are pretty reasonable about liftoff right now.  Our goal is basically to explain in a smooth and easy-to-understand way that we are moving closer to liftoff.  There are different ways to do that, and my main comments are that I’m more concerned about the word “patient” than maybe I was about “considerable time.”  So let me explain my concerns around the word “patient.”  And I beg the Committee’s patience in listening to my concerns.  I will make a promise here:  I will leave time for everyone to finish their holiday shopping. There’s always a risk of misinterpretation when we change words or when we add a word to the statement or subtract something, and that’s just part of life.  But I do think that the word “patient” does bring up a couple of issues.  Specifically, my concern about the word “patient” boils down to:  I myself didn’t really know what it meant in terms of monetary policy.  And I’m going to get back to the Chair’s suggestion because I think that’s an important element of our communications strategy. There are two competing definitions out there, and they differ dramatically.  One interpretation of “patient” is “relatively soon.”  As President Lockhart said, that’s how we used “patient” back in January and March of 2004.  “Patient” meant that we’re going to raise rates in the next few meetings.  So let’s go back to March 2004, the last time we used “patient.”  Well, that FOMC raised the funds rate in June 2004.  That’s two meetings after the use of “patient.” Then I went to a dictionary and looked up the word “patient,” and, actually, the definition is exactly the opposite.  It means “not soon,” and I assume that’s the usage that my esteemed 127 of 219\f",
      "colleague President Evans means when he says on numerous occasions that we need to be patient in removing accommodation.  I believe President Evans would describe “sometime in 2016,” perhaps, as actually being patient.  So, what is the FOMC trying to communicate with this word “patient”?  Is it soon or not soon? I figured this out on my own—I guessed that these problems were recognized, and that led to the classic Fed “belt and suspenders” approach that we always take, which is to anchor expectations on, apparently, this first definition, in which “patient” means “relatively soon.”  Now, the belt is the additional language in the statement that says that the “patient” language is exactly entirely consistent with the October “considerable time” language.  There’s no change there.  And the suspenders of this approach are Chair Yellen’s proposal that she explain in today’s press conference that “patient” means no increase in the next few meetings. Now, actually, after going through my concerns about what “patient” means, I think this does define “patient.”  It’s a very effective way to explain what the word “patient” means here.  It does, I hope, shift us away from what “patient” meant in 2004.  The combination of putting in the belt of that extra sentence and adding the suspenders of the Chair explaining and putting a good commentary about what “patient” means and its data dependence actually solves these problems.  Therefore, I can support the language that’s in the statement, conditional both on having that sentence in the paragraph that says that this is not a change in our views, and on the Chair’s having permission to describe what “patient” means. I do have some lingering concerns that, when there’s consequential language in our policy decisions, I would prefer them to be explained in the statement rather than relying on the Chair to define the terms, but maybe that’s a conversation for a later day.  But, Madam Chair, I 128 of 219\f",
      "do have great confidence that, in the press conference, you’ll be able to explain this very effectively.  So I think that this will be fine. In terms of the questions you asked, my answer to the first one is that I agree, I do think that you should define “patient” as meaning no increase for at least the next couple of meetings, along with the data dependence and all of that, and no decision on liftoff being made.  And I do agree with your summarizing the SEP views on the conditions at liftoff as being further labor sure that this isn’t described as necessary conditions for liftoff—that we need a 1.5 percent on inflation or a 5.7 percent or something on unemployment—but that it’s described as, under the current view of the Committee, these are the conditions that are expected around liftoff.

      "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a couple of remarks.  I’m going to deviate from my prepared text to start off with, and then I’ll come back to my prepared text. My first remark is about the thinking, as I hear it, around liftoff.  I’m concerned, I guess, about the thinking of liftoff as this discrete event.  President Mester described it as historic.  I think President Lockhart has used that same term in public remarks.  I worry that we’re bulking it too large as a discrete event and that we’re viewing it as very irreversible. I listened to your description of the conditions that are likely to prevail at the time of liftoff.  This is obviously not going to be my preferred policy path, but I thought you did a good job yesterday of describing the conditions that are likely to prevail.  Inflation might be well below target still at that time.  I think we have to face the fact that this Committee is going to be very—well, let me say a couple of things.  One is, it would be better if we were to be planning more strategically about what post-liftoff policy is going to look like.  We have a little bit of time left.  We don’t want to have it be that we’re going to raise interest rates by 25 basis points every other meeting.  We want to have something that’s more responsive to the ebb and flow of data than just having a sequence or plan like that.  And we want to be prepared psychologically, within the Committee and publicly, for the possibility that we might return to the zero lower bound, if necessary, to stimulate the economy if conditions evolve accordingly. If we build this up too much externally, communicating that liftoff is a historic event and we’re finally liberating the U.S. economy from the chains that it’s been in for the past eight years, that makes it very challenging for us to reverse course after liftoff.  So there are two aspects to what I’m trying to say.  The first is planning more strategically within the Committee 151 of 219\f",
      "for what we’re going to be doing after liftoff, and then the second is communicating, I think, about what that strategy is likely to be. The second piece I wanted to comment on concerns my thinking.  I believe it’s useful to tie back our policy recommendations to our consensus statement.  So I want to say a couple of things about the maximum-employment mandate.  We’ve had a great year in terms of employment.  President Plosser emphasized the right points yesterday.  I agree with this completely.  It was a fantastic year in terms of employment.  But my thinking about the employment mandate is basically asymmetric.  I don’t believe that it was included in the Federal Reserve Act as a way to tighten policy.  It’s fundamentally in there as a way to provide a way to ease policy relative to what would be true if we had only a price-stability mandate.  More colloquially, no one is going to complain to the Federal Reserve, “You’ve created way too many jobs.  Stop creating so many jobs.”  That’s what promoting maximum employment means—trying to make jobs as high as you can, given you’ve got a price-stability mandate. So the growth in employment is very welcome.  It hasn’t influenced my inflation outlook that much relative to a year ago, though, for a variety of reasons.  So I don’t view it as necessitating a change in policy stance.  And, regarding a concern that President Plosser raised about employment—if we overshoot on employment, we might have to raise rates in order to bring it back down—I think you’d want to average out.  You might have high employment for some period of time and then have lower employment later.  The higher employment is a good thing, so we want to take that into account as a positive sign.  We’re not about changes per se—it’s about the levels we’re trying to achieve. 152 of 219\f",
      "Okay.  Those are the two things I wanted to hit on.  I hope I’m encouraging a more strategic approach to both thinking and communicating about post-liftoff policy, and at least my own thinking about the employment mandate is, as I described, basically asymmetric. With all of that in mind, Madam Chair, at this meeting I’m unwilling to support alternative B.  I would have been willing to support alternative A, especially with paragraph 3ʹ.  But, as you’ll hear, my analysis of the current situation suggests that an even stronger response is desirable.  The situation as I see it is characterized by three key facts.  The first fact is about past inflation.  Year-over-year inflation has run below our 2 percent target for over 30 months.  Essentially since the time we announced the target, it’s fallen below target and has stayed below target. The second fact is about future inflation.  The current FOMC staff projection is that inflation will be below target in each of the next four years.  There is risk to that outlook, as Governor Fischer reminded us yesterday.  We should be thinking about this.  I believe the right way to think about this is more in probability space.  The staff projection means that in the staff’s assessment, in any of the next four years, the probability of inflation’s being below target is larger than 50 percent.  If we weight that, as our Minneapolis memo encouraged us to do, by what kinds of real conditions associated with those low-inflation outcomes are likely to prevail, I think you would be driven to say that the likelihood of low inflation is larger even than 50 percent. forecast, for four years. Fact 1:  We’ve had low, below-target inflation for 30 months. Fact 2:  Future inflation looks as though it’s going to be low, according to the staff 153 of 219\f",
      "Fact 3:  Longer-term inflation expectations have declined.  From November 2010 through that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.  Because of the decline in longer-term inflation expectations in the past few months, at least as reflected in the market-based measures, the Committee has not been able to make this assertion in the past two FOMC statements—and in the one that I suspect will be issued today. What is a proposed response to these three facts—low inflation for the past two and a half years, low inflation for the next four years, and declining long-term inflation expectations?  The proposed response to these three facts in alternative B is to communicate that the FOMC is continuing on the path of gradual removal of accommodation that it initiated a year ago—or, more arguably, in May 2013. In my assessment, the FOMC’s failure to respond to weak inflation runs the risk of creating a harmful downward slide in inflation and inflation expectations of the kind that we have seen in Japan and Europe.  I’ll emphasize again that I see this as a risk.  It’s not my baseline outlook—it is a risk.  I see this risk as unacceptable, given how hard it would be for the FOMC to respond successfully if this risk did, in fact, materialize. As I said, I would have been willing to support alternative A at this meeting.  But my preferred response would be for the FOMC to communicate that it’ll keep the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for the inflation rate remains below 2 percent.  Going further than that, I think the FOMC should also make clear that, if this forward guidance were to prove inadequate in terms of moving inflation back to target, the Committee is willing to use additional tools, such as asset purchases, to push inflation and inflation expectations upward.

      "MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B, and I would also support removing “somewhat.” If the economy moves generally along the baseline path, then I would support lifting off in June, other things being equal.  I don’t see March as at all off the table.  It would take strong results to justify it, but I didn’t think in September that we would have the kinds of employment reports we’ve had since September.  So if you can imagine, we get three more employment reports between now and the March meeting, and, if we get really strong employment reports and, in addition, inflation provides grounds for confidence in a return to 2 percent, then I would see March as potentially on the table as well.  Having said that, I also put significant probability mass on liftoff later than June, as in the primary dealer survey.  It’s all going to depend on the path of the economy.  I actually think we’re getting to the point at which personal assessments of probability matter less than having a plan for dealing with the entire probability distribution. Getting to the language, I do like “patient” for both practical and other reasons.  First, in terms of “considerable time,” I guess I regard “considerable time” as effectively out of the statement, given, as President Mester pointed out, that this is really referring back to a previous statement.  It effectively is a dead letter and certainly will be a dead letter during the press conference.  When someone asks you if it’ll be in the January statement, I suspect you’ll say, “No.”  So I think it is out of the statement for all practical purposes at that point. I also think we’re talking now about one or two meetings in either direction, and there’s not a lot that really rides on that in the long run.  As long as we are transparent, predictable, and data-based in what we do here, it’ll be okay. Having said that, there’s another reason that I like the word “patient”:  I look at the risk weighting of undershooting and overshooting by a couple of meetings as asymmetric.  The very 166 of 219\f",
      "difficult mistake to recover from would be to go too soon.  Maybe there’s an exogenous event, but, in any case, we go, and then suddenly things turn bad for some reason that will look really obvious in hindsight.  Now we’re sitting around this table talking about restarting the asset purchase program and suffering from immense criticism that will be very hard to defend.  That’s a place where we really don’t want to be.  If we turn out to be a meeting or two late, we can move a little faster.  There are ways to deal with that.  I just don’t see those risks as particularly symmetric. I think it’s appropriate at this time to start to prepare the public—the markets, really—for the onset of normalization.  There could easily be a reaction in the markets after this statement.  I think that would be appropriate. Turning to your two questions at the beginning of this round, Madam Chair, I’m okay with your definition of “patient.”  I do think we need a shorter-handled tool, in a way.  “Considerable time” was really a six-month tool.  “Patient” is really a two-meeting tool.  I realize that’s time based and kind of awkward, but it’s also swimming in a sea of data dependency and seems to work, and we should do what works. In terms of leaving meetings on the table, I’ll conclude with this thought:  It’s really a bad idea to think that we could raise rates and do it in the sense of calling a press conference suddenly at the end of a meeting or the day of a meeting.  That is not a way I would go at all.  I just think it can’t be that important to do it.  It would have to be really important to raise rates then rather than seven weeks later.  It would be a big surprise to the market.  This is a tremendously important event in our history, and it ought not to be thrown together in that way.  So I guess I would offer for consideration a thought that, if it’s a close call in March, then there would be an option to put April on the table, and maybe July as well, at that time, but well in 167 of 219\f",
      "advance.  If we’re going to put April on the table, I wouldn’t do it on the day of the meeting.  I would do it as part of the March meeting so that we don’t surprise the market. As I said, it’s really critical that we be transparent.  The market will come to understand what we’re going to do if we’re transparent and predictable, and that’s tremendously important in this process.  Thank you, Madam Chair. \n",
